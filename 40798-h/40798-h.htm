<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>
<p>In this volume I have endeavoured to fulfil the promise made in the former
      one to describe the Reformed Churches, the Anabaptist and Socinian
      movements and the Counter-Reformation in the sixteenth century.</p>
<p>It has been based on a careful study of contemporary sources of information,
      and no important fact has been recorded for which there is not contemporary
      evidence. Full use has been made of work done by predecessors in the
      same field. The sources and the later books consulted have been named
      at the beginning of each chapter; but special reference is due to the
      writings of Professor Pollard on the reigns of Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> and
      Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span>, and to those of MM. Lemonnier
      and Mari&eacute;jol for the history of Protestantism in France. The
      sources consulted are, for the most part, printed in Calendars of State
      Papers issued by the various Governments of Europe, or in the correspondence
      of prominent men and women of the sixteenth century, edited and published
      for Historical and Arch&aelig;ological Societies; but the Calendar
      of State Papers, Domestic, relating to the reigns of Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span>,
      Mary, and Elizabeth, is little more than a brief account of the contents
      of the documents, and has to be supplemented by reference to the original
      documents in the Record Office.</p>
<p>The field covered in this volume is so extensive that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg
                  viii]</a></span> the accounts of the rise and progress
                  of the Reformation in the various countries included had
                  to be very much condensed. I have purposely given a larger
                  space to the beginnings of each movement, believing them
                  to be less known and more deserving of study. One omission
                  must be noted. Nothing has been said directly about the
                  Reformed Churches in Bohemia, Hungary, and the neighbouring
                  lands. It would have been easy to devote a few pages to
                  the subject: but such a brief description would have been
                  misleading. The rise, continuance, and decline of these
                  Churches are so inseparably connected with the peculiar
                  social and political conditions of the countries, that
                  no adequate or informing account of them could be given
                  without largely exceeding the limits of space at my disposal.</p>
<p>After the volume had been fully printed, and addition or alteration was
      impossible, two important documents bearing on subjects discussed came
      into my hands too late for references in the text.</p>
<p>I have found that the Library of the Technical College in Glasgow contains
      a copy, probably unique, of the famous Hymn-book of the <i>Brethren</i> published
      at Ulm in 1538. It is entitled: <i>Ein hubsch neu Gesangbuch darinnen
      begrieffen die Kirchenordnung und Geseng die z&uuml;r Lants Kron und
      Fulneck in Behem, von der Christlichen Bruderschafft den Piccarden,
      die bishero f&uuml;r Unchristen und Ketzer gehalten, gebraucht und
      teglich Gutt zum Ehren gesungen werden.</i> Gedruckt zu Ulm bey Hans
      Varnier. An. <span class="smcap">MDXXXVIII.</span> I know of a copy
      of much later date in N&uuml;rnberg; but of no perfect copy of this
      early impression. It is sufficient to say that the book confirms what
      I have said of the character of the religion of the <i>Brethren</i>.</p>
<p>Then in December 1906, Se&ntilde;or Henriques published at Lisbon the
      authentic records of the trial of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg
      ix]</a></span> George Buchanan and two fellow professors in the Coimbra
      College before the Inquisition. These records show that the prosecution
      had not been instigated by the Jesuits, as was generally conjectured,
      but was due to the malice of a former Principal of the College. The
      statement made on p. 556 has therefore to be corrected.</p>
<p>The kindness of the publishers has provided an historical map, which I
      trust will be found useful. It gives, I think for the first time, a
      representation to the eye of the wide extent of the Anabaptist movement.
      The red bars denote districts where contemporary documents attest the
      existence of Anabaptist communities. At least four maps, representing
      successive periods, would be needed to show with exactness the shifting
      boundaries of the various confessions: one map can only give the general
      results.</p>
<p>My thanks are again due to my colleague, Dr. Denney, and to another friend,
      for the care they have taken in revising the proof sheets, and for
      many valuable suggestions.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>
<h3>&sect; 1. <i>The Limitations of the Peace of Augsburg.</i></h3>
<p>The Religious Peace of Augsburg (1555) secured the legal recognition of
      the Reformation within the Holy Roman Empire, and consequently within
      European polity. Henceforward States, which declared through their
      responsible rulers that they meant to live after the religion described
      in the <i>Augsburg Confession</i>, were admitted to the comity of nations,
      and the Pope was legally and practically debarred from excommunicating
      them, from placing them under <i>interdict</i>, and from inviting obedient
      neighbouring potentates to conquer and dispossess their sovereigns.
      The Bishop of Rome could no longer, according to the recognised custom
      of the Holy Roman Empire, launch a Bull against a Lutheran prince and
      expect to have its execution enforced as in earlier days. The Popes
      were naturally slow to see this, and had to be reminded of the altered
      state of matters more than once.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></p>
<p>Of course, the exalted Romanist powers, civil and ecclesiastical, never
      meant this settlement to be lasting. They intrigued secretly among
      themselves, and fought openly, against it. The final determined effort
      to overthrow it was that hideous nightmare which goes by the name of
      the Thirty Years&rsquo; War, mainly caused by the determination of the Jesuits
      that by the help of God <i>and</i> the devil, for that, as Carlyle
      has remarked, was the peculiarity of the plan, all Germany must be
      brought back to the obedience of Holy Stepmother Church, and to submission
      to the Supreme Headship of the Holy Roman Empire&mdash;the Supreme
      Headship becoming more and more shadowy as the years passed. The settlement
      lasted, however, and remains in general outline until the present.</p>
<p>But the Religious Peace of Augsburg did not end the revolt against Rome
      which was simmering in every land in Western Europe. It made no provision
      for the multitude of believers in the <i>Augsburg Confession</i>, whose
      princes, for conscience&rsquo; sake or for worldly policy, remained steadfast
      to Rome, save that they were to be permitted to emigrate to territories
      where the rulers were of the same faith as theirs. These Lutherans
      were to be found in every part of Germany, and were very abundant in
      the Duchy of Austria. The statement of Faber, the Bishop of Vienna,
      that the only good Catholics in that city were himself and the Archduke
      Ferdinand, was, of course, rhetorical; but it is a proof of the numbers
      of the followers of Luther.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>
<p>It chained irrevocably to the Romanist creed, by the clause called the <i>ecclesiastical
            reservation</i>, not merely the people, but the rulers in the
            numerous ecclesiastical principalities scattered all over Germany.
            This provision secured that if an ecclesiastical prince adopted
            the Lutheran faith, he was to be deprived of his principality.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg
            3]</a></span> It is probable that this provision did more than
            anything else to secure for the Romanists the position they now
            have in Germany. It was partly due to the alarms excited by the
            fact that Albert of Brandenburg, Master of the Teutonic Knights,
            had secularised his land of East Prussia and had become a Lutheran,
            and by the narrow escape of the province of K&ouml;ln from following
            in the same path, under its reforming archbishop, Hermann von
            Wied.</p>
<p>The Peace of Augsburg made no provision for any Protestants other than
      those who accepted the Augsburg Confession; and thousands in the Palatinate
      and all throughout South Germany preferred another type of Protestant
      faith. It is probable that, had Luther lived for ten or fifteen years
      longer, the great division between the Reformed or Calvinist and the
      Evangelical or Lutheran Churches would have been bridged over; but
      after his death his successors, intent to maintain, as they expressed
      it, the deposit of truth which Luther had left, actually ostracised
      Melanchthon for his endeavour to heal the breach. The consequence was
      that the Lutheran Church within Germany after 1555 lost large districts
      to the Reformed Church.</p>
<p>Under Elector Frederick <span class="smcap">III.</span>, surnamed the
      Pious, the territorial Church of the Palatinate separated from the
      circle of Lutheran Churches, and in 1563 the Heidelberg Catechism was
      published. This celebrated doctrinal formula at once became, and has
      remained, the distinctive creed of the various branches of the Reformed
      Church within Germany; and its influence extended even farther.</p>
<p>Bremen followed the example of the Palatinate in 1568. Its divines published
      a doctrinal <i>Declaration</i> in 1572, and a more lengthy <i>Consensus
      Bremenensis</i> in 1595. Anhalt, under its ruler John George (1587-1603),
      did away with the consistorial system of Church government, and abandoned
      the use of Luther&rsquo;s Catechism. Hesse-Cassel joined the circle of German
      Reformed Churches in 1605. These examples were followed in many smaller
      principalities, most of which, imitating all the Reformed Churches,
      published separate and distinctive confessions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg
      4]</a></span> faith, which were nevertheless supposed to contain the
      sum and substance of the common Reformed creed.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>
<p>These German principalities, rulers and inhabitants, placed themselves
      deliberately outside the protection of the Religious Peace of Augsburg.
      The fundamental principles of their faith were not very different from
      the Lutheran, but they were important enough to make them forego the
      protection which the treaty afforded. Setting aside minor differences
      and sentiments, perhaps more powerful than doctrines, their separation
      from neighbouring Protestants was based on their objection to the doctrine
      of <i>Ubiquity</i>, essential to the Lutheran theory of the Sacrament
      of the Supper, and to the consistorial system of ecclesiastical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg
      5]</a></span> government. They repudiated the two portions of the Lutheran
      system which were derived professedly from the medi&aelig;val Church,
      and insisted on basing their exposition of doctrine and their scheme
      of ecclesiastical government more directly on the Word of God. They
      had come in contact with another reformation movement, had recognised
      its sturdier principles, and had become so enamoured of them that they
      felt compelled to leave the Lutheran Church for the Reformed.</p>
<p>Still confining ourselves to Germany, it is to be noticed that the Augsburg
      Confession ostentatiously and over and over again separated those who
      accepted it from protesters against the medi&aelig;val Church, who
      were called Anabaptists. It repudiated views supposed to be held by
      them on Baptism, the Holy Scripture, the possibility of a life of sinless
      perfection, and the relation of Christian men to the magistracy. In
      some of the truces arranged between the Emperor and the evangelical
      princes,&mdash;truces which anticipated the religious Peace of Augsburg,&mdash;attempts
      were made to induce Lutherans and Romanists to unite in suppressing
      those sectaries. It is needless to say that <i>they</i> were not included
      in the settlement in 1555. Yet they had spread all over Germany, endured
      with constancy bloody persecutions, and from them have come the large
      and influential Baptist Churches in Europe and America. From beginning
      to end they were outside the Lutheran Reformation.</p>
<h3>&sect; 2. <i>The Reformation outside Germany.</i></h3>
<p>When we go beyond Germany and survey the other countries of Western Europe,
      it is abundantly evident that the story of the Lutheran movement from
      its beginning down to its successful issue in the Religious Peace of
      Augsburg is only a small part of the history of the Reformation. France,
      Great Britain, the Netherlands, Bohemia, Hungary, even Italy, Spain,
      and Poland, throbbed with the religious revival of the sixteenth century,
      and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> manifestations
      in these lands differed in many respects from that which belonged to
      Germany. All shared with Germany the common experiences, intellectual
      and religious, political and economic, of that period of transition
      which is called the Renaissance in the wider sense of the word&mdash;the
      transition from medi&aelig;val to modern life.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> They
      had all come to the parting of the ways. They had all emerged from
      Medi&aelig;valism, and all saw the wider outlook which was the heritage
      of the time. All felt the same longing to shake themselves clear of
      the incubus of clericalism which weighed heavily on their national
      life, whether religious or political. Each land went forward, marching
      by its own path marked out for it by its past history, intellectual,
      religious, and civil. The movements in these various countries towards
      a freer and more real religious life cannot be described in the same
      general terms; but if Italy and Spain be excepted, their attempts at
      a national reformation had one thing in common which definitely separated
      them from the Lutheran movement.</p>
<h3>&sect; 3. <i>The Reformed type of Doctrine.</i></h3>
<p>If the type of doctrine professed by the Protestants in those countries
      be considered (confessedly a partial, one-sided, and imperfect standard),
      it may be said that they all refused to accept some of the distinctive
      Lutheran dogmatic conclusions, and that they all departed more widely
      from some of the conceptions of the Medi&aelig;val Church. Their national
      confessions in their final forms borrowed more from Zurich and Geneva
      than from Wittenberg, and they all belong to the Reformed as distinguished
      from the Lutheran or Evangelical circle of creeds.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> It
      was perhaps natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg
      7]</a></span> that differences in the ritual and theory of the Holy
      Supper, the very apex and crown of Christian Public Worship, should
      be to the general eye the visible cleavage between rival forms of Christianity.
      In the earlier stages of the Reformation movement, the great popular
      distinction between the Romanists and Protestants was that the one
      refused and the other admitted the laity to partake of the Cup of Communion;
      and later, within an orthodox Protestantism, the thought of <i>ubiquity</i> was
      the dividing line. The Lutherans asserted and the Reformed denied or
      ignored the doctrine; and those confessions took the Reformed view.</p>
<h3>&sect; 4. <i>The Reformed ideal of Ecclesiastical Government.</i></h3>
<p>This similarity of published creed was the one <i>positive</i> bond which
      united all those Churches; but it may also be said that all of them,
      with the doubtful exception of the Church of England,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> would
      have nothing to do with the consistorial system of the Lutheran Churches,
      and that most of them accepted in theory at least Calvin&rsquo;s conception
      of ecclesiastical government. They strove to get away from the medi&aelig;val
      ideas of ecclesiastical rule, and to return to the principles which
      they believed to be laid down for them in the New Testament, illustrated
      by the conduct of the Church of the early centuries. The Church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg
      8]</a></span> according to Calvin, was a theocratic democracy, and
      the ultimate source of authority lay in the membership of the Christian
      community, inspired by the Presence of Christ promised to all His people.
      But in the sixteenth century this conception was confronted and largely
      qualified in practice, by the dread that it might lead to a return
      to the clerical tutelage of the medi&aelig;val Church from which they
      had just escaped. Presbyter might become priest writ large; and the
      leaders of the Reformation in many lands could see, as Zwingli did
      in Zurich and Cranmer in England, that the civil authorities might
      well represent the Christian democracy. Even Calvin in Geneva had to
      content himself with ecclesiastical ordinances which left the Church
      completely under the control of <i>les tr&egrave;s honnor&egrave;s
      seigneurs syndicques et conseil de Gen&egrave;ve</i>; and the Scottish
      Church in 1572 had to recognise that the King was the
      &ldquo;Supreme Governor of this realm as well in things temporal as in the
      conservation and purgation of religion.&rdquo;
      The nations and principalities in Western Europe which had adopted
      and supported the Reformation believed that manifold abuses had arisen
      in the past, directly and indirectly, through the exemption of the
      Church and its possessions from secular control, and they were determined
      not to permit the possibility of a return to such a state of things.
      The scholarship of the Renaissance had discovered the true text of
      the old Roman Civil Code, and one of the features of that time of transition&mdash;perhaps
      its most important and far-reaching feature, for law enters into every
      relation of human life&mdash;was the substitution of civil law based
      on the Codes of Justinian and Theodosius, for canon law based on the
      Decretum of Gratian. These old Roman codes taught the lawyers and statesmen
      of the sixteenth century to look upon the Church as a department of
      the State; and the thought that the Christian community had an independent
      life of its own, and that its guidance and discipline ought to be in
      the hands of office-bearers chosen by its membership, was everywhere
      confronted, modified, largely overthrown by the imperious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg
      9]</a></span> claim of the civilian lawyers. Ecclesiastical leaders
      within the Reformed Churches might strive as they liked to draw the
      line between the possessions of the Church, which they willingly placed
      under the control of civil law, and its discipline in matters of faith
      and morals, which they declared to be the inalienable possession of
      the Church; but, as a rule, the State refused to perceive the distinction,
      and insisted in maintaining full control over the ecclesiastical jurisdiction.
      Hence it came about that in every land where the secular authorities
      were favourable to the Reformation, the Church became more or less
      subject to the State; and this resulted in a large variety of ecclesiastical
      organisations in communities all belonging to the Reformed Church.
      While it may be said with perfect truth that the churchly ideal in
      the minds of the leaders in most of the Reformed Churches was to restore
      the theocratic democracy of the early centuries, and that this was
      a strong point of contrast between them and Luther, who insisted that
      the <i>jus episcopale</i> belonged to the civil magistrate, in practice
      the secular authorities in Switzerland, the Netherlands, the Palatinate,
      etc., kept almost as tight a hold on the Reformed national Churches
      as did the Lutheran princes and municipalities. In one land only, France,
      the ecclesiastical ideal of Calvin had full liberty to embody itself
      in a constitution, and that only because the French Reformed Church
      struggled into existence under the civil rule of a Romanist State,
      and, like the Christian Church of the early centuries, maintained itself
      in spite of the opposition of the secular authorities which persecuted
      it.</p>
<h3>&sect; 5. <i>The Influence of Humanism on the Reformed Churches.</i></h3>
<p>The portion of the Reformation which lay outside the Peace of Augsburg
      had another characteristic which distinguished it from the Lutheran
      Reformation included within the treaty&mdash;it owed much more to Humanism.
      Erasmus and what he represented had a greater share in its birth and
      early progress, and his influence appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg
      10]</a></span> amidst the most dissimilar surroundings. Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> and
      Zwingli seem to stand at opposite poles; yet the English autocrat and
      the Swiss democrat were alike in this, that they owed much to Erasmus,
      and that the reformations which they respectively led were largely
      prompted by the impulse of Humanism. One has only to compare the <i>Bishops&rsquo;
      Book</i> and the <i>King&rsquo;s Book</i> of the Henrican period in England
      with the many statements Erasmus has made about the kind of reformation
      he desired to see, to recognise that they were meant to serve for a
      reformation in life and morals which would leave untouched the fundamental
      doctrinal system of the medi&aelig;val Church and its organisation
      in accordance with the principles laid down by the great Humanist.
      The Bible, the Apostles&rsquo;, Nicene, and Athanasian Creeds, with the doctrinal
      decisions of the first four &#338;cumenical Councils, were recognised
      as the standards of orthodoxy in the <i>Ten Articles</i>; and the Scholastic
      Theology, so derided by Erasmus, was contemptuously ignored. The accompanying <i>Injunctions</i> set
      little store by pilgrimages, relics, and indulgences, and the other
      superstitions of the popular religious life which the great Humanist
      had treated sarcastically. The two books alluded to above are full
      of instructions for leading a wholesome life. The whole programme of
      reformation is laid down on lines borrowed from Erasmus.</p>
<p>Zwingli was under the influence of Humanism from his boyhood. His young
      intellect was fed on the masterpieces of classical antiquity&mdash;Cicero,
      Homer, and Pindar. His favourite teacher was Thomas Wyttenbach, who
      was half a Reformer and half a pure follower of Erasmus. No man influenced
      him more than the learned Dutchman. It was his guidance and not the
      example of Luther which made him study the Scriptures and the theologians
      of the early Church, such as Origen, Jerome, and Chrysostom. The influence
      and example of Erasmus can be seen even in his attempts to create a
      rational theory of the Holy Supper. His reformation, in its beginning
      more especially, was much more an intellectual than a religious movement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg
      11]</a></span> It aimed at a clearer understanding of the Holy Scriptures,
      at the purgation of the popular religious life from idolatry and superstition,
      and at a clearly reasoned out scheme of intellectual belief. The deeper
      religious impulse which drove Luther, step by step, in his path of
      revolt from the medi&aelig;val Church was lacking in Zwingli. He owed
      little to Wittenberg, much to Rotterdam. It was this connection with
      Erasmus that created the sympathy between Zwingli and such early Dutch
      Reformers as Christopher Hoen, and made the Swiss Reformer a power
      in the earlier stages of the Reformation in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The beginnings of the Reformation movement in France, Italy, and Spain
      were even more closely allied to Humanism.</p>
<p>If the preparation for reformation to be found in the work and teaching
      of medi&aelig;val evangelical nonconformists like the <i>Picards</i> be
      set aside, the beginnings of the Reformation in France must be traced
      to the small group of Christian Humanists who surrounded Marguerite
      d&rsquo;Angoul&ecirc;me and Bri&ccedil;onnet the Bishop of Meaux. Marguerite
      herself and Jacques Lef&egrave;vre d&rsquo;&Eacute;taples, the real leader
      of the group of scholars and preachers, found solace for soul troubles
      in the Christian Platonism to which so many of the Humanists north
      and south of the Alps had given themselves. The aim of the little circle
      of enthusiasts was a reformation of the Church and of society on the
      lines laid down by Erasmus. They looked to reform without &ldquo;tumult,&rdquo; to
      a reformation of the Church by the Church and within the Church, brought
      about by a study of the Scriptures, and especially of the Epistles
      of St. Paul, by individual Christians weaning themselves from the world
      while they remained in society, and by slowly leavening the people
      with the enlightenment which the New Learning was sure to bring. They
      cared little for theology, much for intimacy with Christ; little for
      external changes in institutions, much for personal piety. Their efforts
      had little visible effect, and their <i>via media</i> between the stubborn
      defenders of Scholasticism on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg
      12]</a></span> one hand and more thorough Reformers on the other, was
      found to be an impossible path to persevere in; but it must not be
      forgotten that they did much to prepare France for the Reformation
      movement which they really inaugurated; nor that William Farel, the
      precursor of Calvin himself in Geneva, belonged to the &ldquo;group of Meaux.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Humanism influenced the &ldquo;group of Meaux,&rdquo; who were the advance guard
      of the French Reformation, it manifested itself no less powerfully
      in the training of Calvin, who in 1536 unconsciously became the leader
      of the movement. He was one of the earliest and most enthusiastic students
      of the band of &ldquo;royal lecturers&rdquo;
      appointed by Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span> to give France the
      benefits of the New Learning. He had intimate personal relations with
      Bud&eacute; and Cop, who were allied to the &ldquo;group of Meaux,&rdquo;
      and were leaders among the Humanists in the University. His earliest
      book, a Commentary on the <i>De Clementia</i> of Seneca, shows how
      wide and minute was his knowledge of the Greek and Latin classical
      authors. Like Erasmus, he does not seem to have been much influenced
      by the mystical combination of Platonism and Christianity which entranced
      the Christian Humanists of Italy and filled the minds of the &ldquo;group
      of Meaux&rdquo;; and like him he broke through the narrow circle of elegant
      trifling within which most of the Italian scholars were confined, and
      used the New Learning for modern purposes. Humanism taught him to think
      imperially in the best fashion of ancient Rome, to see that great moral
      ideas ought to rule in the government of men. It filled him with a
      generous indignation at the evils which flowed from an abuse of absolute
      and arbitrary power. The young scholar (he was only three-and-twenty)
      attacked the governmental abuses of the times with a boldness which
      revived the best traditions of Roman statesmanship. He denounced venal
      judges who made &ldquo;justice a public merchandise.&rdquo; He declared that princes
      who slew their people or subjected them to wholesale persecution were
      not legitimate rulers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg
      13]</a></span> but brigands, and that brigands were the enemies of
      the whole human race. At a time when persecution was prevalent everywhere,
      the Commentary of the young Humanist pleaded for tolerance in language
      as lofty as Milton employed in his <i>Areopagitica</i>. He was not
      blind to the defects of the stoical morality displayed in the book
      he commented upon. He contrasted the stoical indifference with Christian
      sympathy, and stoical individualism with the thought of Christian society;
      but he seized upon and made his own the loftier moral ideas in Stoicism,
      and applied them to public life. Luther was great, none greater, in
      holding up the liberty of the Christian man; but there he halted, or
      advanced beyond it with very faltering step. Humanism taught Calvin
      the claims and the duties of the Christian society; he proclaimed them
      aloud, and his thoughts spread throughout that portion of the Reformation
      which followed his leadership and accepted his principles. The Holy
      Scriptures, St. Augustine, and the imperial ethics of the old Roman
      Stoicism coming through Humanism, were a trinity of influence on all
      the Reformed Churches.</p>
<p>The Reformation in Spain and Italy was only a brief episode; but in its
      short-lived existence in these lands, Humanism was one of the greatest
      forces supporting it and giving it strength. In both countries the
      young life was quenched in the blood of martyrs. So quickly did it
      pass, that it seems surprising to learn that Erasmus confidently expected
      that Spain would be the land to accomplish the Reformation without &ldquo;tumult&rdquo; which
      he so long looked forward to and expected; that the Scriptures were
      read throughout the Spanish peninsula, and that women vied with men
      in knowledge of their contents, during the earlier part of the sixteenth
      century.</p>
<h3>&sect; 6. <i>What the Reformed Churches owed to Luther.</i></h3>
<p>There was, then, a Reformation movement which in its earliest beginnings
      and in its final outcome was quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg
      14]</a></span> distinct from that under the leadership of Luther; but
      it would be erroneous to say that it was altogether outside Luther&rsquo;s
      influence, and that it owed little or nothing to the great German Reformer.
      It is vain to speculate on what might have been, or to ask whether
      the undoubted movements making for reformation in lands outside Germany
      would have come to fruition had not Luther&rsquo;s trumpet-call sounded over
      Europe. It is enough to state what did actually occur. If it cannot
      be said that the beginnings of the Reformation in every land came from
      Luther, it can scarcely be denied that he gave to his contemporaries
      the inspiration of courage and of assured conviction. He delivered
      men from the fear of priestcraft; he taught men, in a way that no other
      did, that redemption was not a secret science practised by the priests
      within an institution called the Church; that all believers had the
      privilege of direct access to the very presence of God; and that the
      very thought of a priesthood who alone could mediate between God and
      man was both superfluous and irreconcilable with the truest instincts
      of the Christian religion. His teaching had a sounding board of dramatic
      environment which compelled men to listen, to attend, to be impressed,
      to understand, and to follow.</p>
<p>He had been and was a deeply pious man, with the piety of the type most
      esteemed by his contemporaries, and therefore easily understood and
      sympathised with by the common man. His piety had driven him into the
      convent, as then seemed both natural and necessary. Inside the monastery
      he had lived the life of a &ldquo;young saint&rdquo;&mdash;so his fellow monks
      believed, when, in the fashion of the day and of their class, they
      boasted that they had among them one destined to revive again the best
      type of medi&aelig;val saintship. No coarse, vulgar sins of the flesh,
      common enough at the time and easily condoned, smirched his young life.
      When he attained to peace in believing, he had no doubt of his vocation;
      no sudden wrench tore him away from the approved religious life of
      his time; no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg
      15]</a></span> intellectual doubt separated him from the beliefs of
      his Church. His very imperviousness to the intellectual liberalising
      tendencies of Humanism made him all the more fit to be a trusted religious
      leader. He went forward step by step with such a slow, sure foot-tread
      that the common man could see and follow. When he did come forward
      as a Reformer he did not run amuck at things in general. He felt compelled
      to attack the <i>one</i> portion of the popular religious life of the
      times which all men who gave the slightest thought to religion felt
      to be a gross abuse. The way he dealt with it revealed that he was
      the great religious genius of his age&mdash;an age which was imperatively
      if confusedly calling for reform within the sphere of religion.</p>
<p>If to be original means simply to be the first to see and make known a
      single truth or a fresh aspect of a truth, it is possible to contest
      the claim of Luther to be an original thinker. It would not be difficult
      to point out anticipations of almost every separate truth which he
      taught to his generation. To take two only&mdash;Wessel had denounced
      indulgences in language so similar to Luther&rsquo;s, that, when the Reformer
      read it long after the publication of the <i>Theses</i>, he could say
      that people might well imagine that he had simply borrowed from the
      old Dutch theologian; and Lef&egrave;vre d&rsquo;&Eacute;taples had taught
      the doctrine of justification by faith before it had flashed on Luther&rsquo;s
      soul with all the force of a revelation. But if originality be the
      gift to seize, to combine into one organic whole, separate isolated
      truths, to see their bearing upon the practical religious life of all
      men, educated and ignorant, to use the new light to strip the common
      religious life of all paralysing excrescences, to simplify it and to
      make it clear that the sum and essence of Christianity is &ldquo;unwavering
      trust of the heart in Him who has given Himself to us in Christ Jesus
      as our Father, personal assurance of faith because Christ with His
      work undertakes our cause,&rdquo; and to do all this with the tenderest sympathy
      for every true dumb religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg
      16]</a></span> instinct which had made men wander away from the simplicity
      which is in Christ Jesus, then Luther stands alone in his day and generation,
      unapproachable by any other.</p>
<p>Hence it was that to the common people in every land in Europe up till
      about 1540, when Calvin&rsquo;s individuality began to make itself felt,
      Luther represented the Reformation; and all who accepted the new teaching
      were known as Lutherans, whether in England, the Low Countries, France,
      or French speaking Switzerland.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>
<p>Ecclesiastical historians of the Reformed Church from the sixteenth century
      downward have often been inclined to share Luther&rsquo;s supremacy with
      Zwingli. The Swiss Reformer was gifted with many qualities which Luther
      lacked. He stood in freer relation to the doctrines and practices of
      the medi&aelig;val Church, and his scheme of theology was perhaps wider
      and truer than Luther&rsquo;s. He had a keener intellectual insight, and
      was quicker to discern the true doctrinal tendencies of their common
      religious verities. But the way in which he regarded indulgences, and
      his manner of protesting against them, showed his great inferiority
      to Luther as a religious guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh the folly of it!&rdquo; said Zwingli with his master Erasmus,&mdash;&ldquo;the
      crass, unmitigated stupidity of it all!&rdquo; and they scorned it, and laughed
      at it, and attacked it with the light keen shafts of raillery and derisive
      wit. &ldquo;Oh the pity of it!&rdquo; said Luther; and he turned men travelling
      by the wrong road on their quest for pardon (a real quest for them)
      into the right path. Zwingli never seemed to see that under the purchase
      of indulgences, the tramping on pilgrimages from shrine to shrine,
      the kissing, reverencing, and adoring of relics, there was a real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg
      17]</a></span> inarticulate cry for pardon of sins felt if not vividly
      repented of. Luther knew it, and sympathised with it. He was a man
      of the people, not merely because he was a peasant&rsquo;s son and had studied
      at a burgher University, but because he had shared the religion of
      the common people. He had felt with them that the repeated visits of
      the plague, the new mysterious diseases, the dread of the Turks, were
      punishments sent by God because of the sins of the generation. He had
      gone through it all; plunged more deeply in the terror, writhed more
      hopelessly under the wrath of God, wandered farther on the wrong path
      in his quest for pardon, and at last had seen the &ldquo;Beatific Vision.&rdquo; The
      deepest and truest sympathy with fellow-men and the vision of God are
      needed to make a Reformer of the first rank, and Luther had both as
      no other man had, during the first quarter of the sixteenth century.</p>
<p>So men listened to him all over Europe wherever there had been a stirring
      of the heart for reformation, and it would be hard to say where there
      had been none. Czechs, Hungarians, and Poles in the east; Spaniards,
      Englishmen, Frenchmen, Dutch, and Scots in the west; Swedes in the
      north, and Italians in the south&mdash;all welcomed, and read, and
      were moved by what Luther wrote. First the <i>Theses</i>, then sermons
      and tracts, then the trumpet call <i>To the Nobility of the German
      Nation</i> and the <i>Pr&aelig;ludium to the Babylonian Captivity of
      the Church of Christ</i>, and, above all, his booklet <i>On the Liberty
      of a Christian Man</i>. As men read, what had been only a hopeful but
      troubled dream of the night became a vision in the light of day. They
      heard proclaimed aloud in clear unfaltering speech what they had scarcely
      dared to whisper to themselves. Fond and devout imaginations became
      religious certainties. They risked all to get possession of the sayings
      of this &ldquo;man of God.&rdquo; Cautious, dour Scotch burghers ventured ship
      and cargo for the sake of the little quarto tracts hid in the bales
      of cloth which came to the ports of Dundee and Leith. Oxford and Cambridge
      students passed them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg
      18]</a></span> from hand to hand in spite of Wolsey&rsquo;s proclamations
      and Warham&rsquo;s precautions. Luther&rsquo;s writings were eagerly studied in
      Paris by town and University as early as May 1519.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Spanish
      merchants bought Luther&rsquo;s books at the Frankfurt Fair, spent some of
      their hard won profits in getting them translated and printed in Spanish,
      and carried them over the Pyrenees on their pack mules. Under the influence
      of these writings the Reformation took shape, was something more than
      the devout imagination of a few pious thinkers, and became an endeavour
      to give expression to common religious certainties in change of creed,
      institutions, and worship. Thus Luther helped the Reformation in every
      land. The actual beginnings in England, France, the Netherlands, and
      elsewhere had come into existence years before Luther had become known;
      it is possible that the movements might have come to fruition apart
      from his efforts; but the influence of his writings was like that of
      the sun when it quickens and makes the seed sprout that has been &ldquo;happed&rdquo; in
      a tilled and sown field.</p>
<h3>&sect; 7. <i>National Characteristics.</i></h3>
<p>It was not that the Reformation in any of these countries was to become
      Lutheran in the end, or had a Lutheran stage of development. The number
      of genuine Lutherans outside Germany and Scandinavia was very small.
      Here and there a stray one was to be found, like Dr. Barnes in England
      or Louis Berquin in France. One of the deepest principles of the great
      Reformer&rsquo;s teaching itself checked the idea of a purely Lutheran Reformation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg
      19]</a></span> which would embrace the whole Reformation Church. He
      taught that the practical exercise of faith ought to manifest itself
      within the great institutions of human life which have their origin
      in God&mdash;in marriage, the family, the calling, and the State, in
      the ordinary life we lead with its environment. Nations have their
      character and characteristics as well as individual men, and they mould
      in natural ways the expression in creed and institution of the religious
      certainties shared by all. The Reformation in England was based on
      the same spiritual facts and forces which were at work in France, Germany,
      and the Netherlands, but each land had its own ways of embodying them.
      It is interesting to note how national habits, memories, and even prejudices
      compelled the external embodiment to take very varying shapes, and
      force the historian to describe the Reformation in each country as
      something by itself.</p>
<p>The new spiritual life in England took a shape distinctly marked out for
      it by the almost forgotten reformatory movement under Wiclif which
      had been native to the soil. Scotland might have been expected to follow
      the lead of England, and bring her ecclesiastical reconstruction into
      harmony with that of her new and powerful ally. The English alliance
      was the great political fact of the Scottish Reformation, and leading
      statesmen in both countries desired the still nearer approach which
      conformity in the organisation of the Churches could not fail to foster.
      But the memory of the old French alliance was too strong for Cecil
      and Lethington, and Scotland took her methods of Church government
      from France (not from Geneva), and drifted farther and farther away
      from the model of the English settlement. The fifteenth century War
      of the Public Weal repeated itself in the Wars of Religion in France;
      and in the Edict of Nantes the Reformed Church was offered and accepted
      guarantees for her independence such as a feudal prince might have
      demanded. The old political local independence which had characterised
      the Low Countries in the later Middle Ages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg
      20]</a></span> reasserted itself in the ecclesiastical arrangements
      of the Netherlands. The civic republics of Switzerland demanded and
      received an ecclesiastical form of government which suited the needs
      of their social and political life.</p>
<p>Yet amidst all this diversity there was the prevailing sense of an underlying
      unity, and the knowledge that each national Church was part of the
      Catholic Church Reformed was keener than among the Lutheran Churches.
      Protestant England in the time of Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span> welcomed
      and supported refugees banished by the Augsburg Interim from Strassburg.
      Frankfurt received and provided for families who fled from the Marian
      persecutions in England. Geneva became a city of refuge for oppressed
      Protestants from every land, and these strangers frequently added quite
      a third to her population. The feeling of fraternity was maintained,
      as in the days of the early Church, by constant interchange of letters
      and messengers, and correspondence gave a sense of unity which it was
      impossible to embody in external political organisation. The sense
      of a common danger was also a wonderful bond of kinship; and the feeling
      that Philip of Spain was always plotting their destruction, softened
      inter-ecclesiastical jealousies. The same sort of events occurred in
      all the Churches at almost the same times. The Colloquy of Westminster
      (1559) was separated from the Colloquy of Poissy (1561) by an interval
      of two years only, and the same questions were discussed at both. Queen
      Elizabeth openly declared herself a Protestant by partaking of the
      communion in both
      &ldquo;kinds&rdquo; at Easter, 1559; and on the same day Antoine de Bourbon, King
      of Navarre, made the same profession in the same way at Pau in the
      south of France. Mary of Guise resolved that the same festival should
      see the Scots united under the old faith, and thus started the overt
      rebellion which ended in Scotland becoming a Protestant nation.</p>
<p>The course of the Reformation in each country must be described separately,
      and yet it is the one story with differences due to the accidents of
      national temperaments, memories, and political institutions.</p>

<h3>THE REFORMATION IN SWITZERLAND UNDER ZWINGLI.</h3>
<h3>&sect; 1. <i>The political Condition of Switzerland.</i><a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></h3>
<p>Switzerland in the sixteenth century was like no other country in Europe.
      It was as divided as Germany or Italy, and yet it had a unity which
      they could not boast. It was a confederation or little republic of
      communes and towns of the primitive Teutonic type, in which the executive
      power was vested in the community. The various cantons were all independent,
      but they were banded together in a common league, and they had a federal
      flag&mdash;a white cross on a red ground, which bore the motto, &ldquo;Each
      for all, and all for each.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The separate members of the Federation had come into existence in a great
      variety of ways, and all retained the distinctive marks of their earlier
      history. The beginnings go back to the thirteenth century, when the
      three Forest cantons, Schwyz, Uri, and Unterwalden, having freed themselves
      from the dominion of their feudal lords, formed themselves into a <i>Perpetual
      League</i> (1291), in which they pledged themselves to help each other
      to maintain the liberty they had won. After the battle of Morgarten
      they renewed the League at Brunnen (1315), promising again to aid each
      other against all usurping lords. Hapsburg, the cradle of the Imperial
      House of Austria, lies on the south-east<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg
      22]</a></span> bank of the river Aare, and the dread of this great
      feudal family strengthened the bonds of the League; while the victories
      of the independent peasants over the House of Austria, and later over
      the Duke of Burgundy, increased its reputation. The three cantons grew
      to be thirteen&mdash;Schwyz, Uri, Unterwalden, Luzern, Zurich, Bern,
      Glarus, Zug, Freiburg, Basel, Schaffhausen, Solothurn, and Appenzell.
      Other districts, without becoming members of the League, sought its
      protection, such as the Valais and the town and country under the Abbey
      of St. Gallen. Other leagues were formed on its model among the peasantry
      of the Rh&aelig;tian Alps&mdash;in 1396 the <i>League of the House
      of God</i> (<i>Lia da Ca&rsquo; D&egrave;</i>)&mdash;at the head of which
      was the Church at Chur; in 1424 the <i>Graub&uuml;nden</i> (<i>Lia
      Grischa</i> or <i>Gray League</i>); in 1436 the <i>League of the Ten
      Jurisdictions</i> (<i>Lia della desch Dretturas</i>). These three united
      in 1471 to make the <i>Three Perpetual Leagues of Rh&aelig;tia</i>.
      They were in close alliance with the Swiss cantons from the fifteenth
      century, but did not become actual members of the Swiss Confederacy
      until 1803. The Confederacy also made some conquests, and the districts
      conquered were generally governed on forms of mutual agreement between
      several cantons&mdash;a complicated system which led to many bickerings,
      and intensified the quarrels which religion gave rise to in the sixteenth
      century.</p>
<p>Each of these thirteen cantons preserved its own independence and its
      own mode of government. Their political organisation was very varied,
      and dependent to a large extent on their past history. The Forest cantons
      were communes of peasant proprietors, dwelling in inaccessible valleys,
      and their Diet was an assembly of all the male heads of families. Zurich
      was a manufacturing and commercial town which had grown up under the
      protection of an old ecclesiastical settlement whose foundation went
      back to an age beyond that of Charles the Great. Bern was originally
      a hamlet, nestling under the fortified keep of an old feudal family.
      In Zurich the nobles made one of the
      &ldquo;guilds&rdquo; of the town, and the constitution was thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg
      23]</a></span> democratic. Bern, on the other hand, was an aristocratic
      republic. But in all, the power in the last resort belonged to the
      people, who were all freemen with full rights of citizenship.</p>
<p>The Swiss had little experience of episcopal government. Their relations
      with the Papacy had been entirely political or commercial, the main
      article of commerce being soldiers to form the Pope&rsquo;s bodyguard, and
      infantry for his Italian wars, and the business had been transacted
      through Legates. Most of the territory of Switzerland was ecclesiastically
      divided between the archiepiscopal provinces of Mainz and Besan&ccedil;on,
      and the river Aare was the boundary between them. The division went
      back to the beginning of Christianity in the land. The part of Switzerland
      which lay towards France had been Christianised by Roman or Gallic
      missionaries; while the rest, which sloped towards Germany, had been
      won to Christianity by Irish preachers! Basel and Lausanne figure as
      bishoprics under Besan&ccedil;on; while Constance, a bishopric under
      Mainz, asserted episcopal rights over Zurich and the neighbourhood.
      The rugged, mountainous part of the country was vaguely claimed for
      the province of Mainz without being definitely assigned to any diocese.
      This contributed to make the Swiss people singularly independent in
      all ecclesiastical matters, and taught them to manage their Church
      affairs for themselves.</p>
<p>Even in Zurich, which acknowledged the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of
      the Bishop of Constance, the Council insisted on its right of supervising
      Church properties, and convents were under State inspection.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the sixteenth century, intercourse with their neighbours
      was changing the old simple manners of the Swiss. Their repeated victories
      over Charles the Bold of Burgundy had led to the belief that the Swiss
      infantry was the best in Europe, and nations at war with each other
      were eager to hire Swiss troops. The custom had gradually grown up
      among the Swiss cantons of hiring out soldiers to those who paid best
      for them. These mercenaries, demoralised by making merchandise of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg
      24]</a></span> lives in quarrels not their own, and by spending their
      pay in riotous living when they returned to their native valleys, were
      corrupting the population of the Confederacy. The system was demoralising
      in another way. The two great Powers that trafficked in Swiss infantry
      were France and the Papacy; and the French king on the one hand, and
      the Pope on the other, not merely kept permanent agents in the various
      Swiss cantons, but gave pensions to leading citizens to induce them
      to persuade the canton to which they belonged to hire soldiers to the
      one side or the other. Zwingli, in his earlier days, believed that
      the Papacy was the only Power with which the Swiss ought to ally themselves,
      and received a papal pension for many years.</p>
<h3>&sect; 2. <i>Zwingli&rsquo;s Youth and Education.</i><a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></h3>
<p>Huldreich (Ulrich) Zwingli, the Reformer of Switzerland, was born on January
      1st, 1484 (fifty-two days after Luther), in the hamlet of Wildhaus
      (or Wildenhaus), lying in the upper part of the Toggenburg valley,
      raised so high above sea-level (3600 feet) that fruits refuse to ripen.
      It lies so exactly on the central watershed of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg
      25]</a></span> Europe, that the rain which falls on the one side of
      the ridge of the red-tiled church roof goes into a streamlet which
      feeds the Danube, and that which falls on the other finds its way to
      the Rhine. He came third in a large family of eight sons and two daughters.
      His father, also called Huldreich, was the headman of the commune,
      and his uncle, Bartholomew Zwingli, was the parish priest. His education
      was superintended by Bartholomew, who became Dean of Wesen in 1487,
      and took the small Huldreich with him to his new sphere of work. The
      boy was sent to the school in Wesen, where he made rapid progress.
      Bartholomew Zwingli was somewhat of a scholar himself. When he discovered
      that his nephew was a precocious boy, he determined to give him as
      good an education as was possible, and sent him to Basel (Klein-Basel,
      on the east bank of the Rhine) to a famous school taught, by the gentle
      scholar, Gregory Buenzli (1494-98).</p>
<p>In four years the lad had outgrown the teacher&rsquo;s powers of instruction,
      and young Zwingli was sent to Bern to a school taught by the Humanist
      Heinrich W&ouml;lfflin (Lupulus), who was half a follower of Erasmus
      and half a Reformer. He was passionately fond of music, and lodged
      in one of the Dominican convents in the town which was famed for the
      care bestowed on musical education. Zwingli was so carried away by
      his zeal for the study, that he had some thoughts of becoming a monk
      merely to gratify his musical tastes. His family, who had no desire
      to see him enter a monastery, removed him from Bern and sent him to
      the University of Vienna, where he spent two years (1500-1502). There
      he had for friends and fellow-students, Joachim von Watt<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> (Vadianus),
      Heinrich Loriti<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg
      26]</a></span> of Glarus (Glareanus), Johann Heigerlin<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> of
      Leutkirch (Faber), and Johann Maier of Eck, the most notable of
      all Luther&rsquo;s opponents. In 1502 he returned to Switzerland and matriculated
      in the University of Basel. He became B.A. in 1504 and M.A. in 1506,
      and in the same year became parish priest of Glarus.</p>
<p>The childhood and youth of Zwingli form a striking contrast to Luther&rsquo;s
      early years. He enjoyed the rude plenty of a well-to-do Swiss farmhouse,
      and led a joyous young life. He has told us how the family gathered
      in the <i>stube</i> in the long winter evenings, and how his grandmother
      kept the children entranced with her tales from the Bible and her wonderful
      stories of the saints. The family were all musical, and they sang patriotic
      folk-songs, recording in rude verse the glories of Morgarten, Sempach,
      and the victories over the tyrant of Burgundy. &ldquo;When I was a child,&rdquo; says
      Zwingli, &ldquo;if anyone said a word against our Fatherland, it put my back
      up at once.&rdquo; He was trained to be a patriot. &ldquo;From boyhood I have shown
      so great, eager, and sincere a love for our honourable Confederacy
      that I trained myself diligently in every act and discipline to this
      end.&rdquo; His uncle Bartholomew was an admirer of the New Learning, and
      the boy was nurtured in everything that went to make a Humanist, with
      all its virtues and failings. He was educated, one might almost say,
      in the art of enjoying the present without discriminating much between
      what was good and evil in surrounding society. He was trained to take
      life as it came. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg
      27]</a></span> great sense of sin troubled his youthful years. He never
      shuddered at the wrathful face of Jesus, the Judge, gazing at him from
      blazoned church window. If he was once tempted for a moment to become
      a monk, it was in order to enjoy musical society, not to quench the
      sin that was burning him within, and to win the pardon of an angry
      God. He took his ecclesiastical calling in a careless, professional
      way. He belonged to a family connected on both sides with the clergy,
      and he followed the family arrangement. Until far on in life the question
      of personal piety did not seem to trouble him much, and he never belonged,
      like Luther and Calvin, to the type of men who are the leaders in a
      revival of personal religion. He became a Reformer because he was a
      Humanist, with a liking for Augustinian theology; and his was such
      a frank, honest nature that he could not see cheats and shams done
      in the name of religion without denouncing them. To the end of his
      days he was led more by his intellect than by the promptings of the
      heart, and in his earlier years he was able to combine a deep sense
      of responsibility about most things with a careless laxity of moral
      life.</p>
<h3>&sect; 3. <i>At Glarus and Einsiedeln.</i></h3>
<p>At Glarus he was able to follow his Humanist studies, guided by the influences
      which had surrounded him during his last year at Basel. Among these
      his friendship with Thomas Wyttenbach was the most lasting. Wyttenbach
      taught him, he tells us, to see the evils and abuses of indulgences,
      the supreme authority of the Bible, that the death of Christ was the
      sole price of the remission of sins, and that faith is the key which
      unlocks to the soul the treasury of remission. All these thoughts he
      had grasped intellectually, and made much of them in his sermons. He
      prized preaching highly, and resolved to cultivate the gift by training
      himself on the models of antiquity. He studied the Scriptures, joyfully
      welcomed the new Greek Testament of Erasmus, published by Froben<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg
      28]</a></span> of Basel in 1516, when he was at Einsiedeln, and copied
      out from it the whole of the Pauline Epistles. On the wide margins
      of his MS. he wrote annotations from Erasmus, Origen, Chrysostom, Ambrose,
      and Jerome. It was his constant companion.</p>
<p>At Glarus he was personally introduced to the system of mercenary war
      and of pensions in which Switzerland had engaged. He went to Italy
      twice as regimental chaplain with the Glarus contingent, and was present
      at the fight at Novara (1513), and on the fatal day at Marignano (1515).</p>
<p>His experiences in these campaigns convinced him of the harm in this system
      of hiring out the Swiss to fight in others&rsquo; quarrels; and when he became
      convinced of the evils attending it, he denounced the practice. His
      outspoken language displeased many of his most influential parishioners,
      especially those who were partisans of the French, and Zwingli resolved
      to seek some other sphere of work.</p>
<p>The post of people&rsquo;s priest at Einsiedeln, the famous monastery and pilgrimage
      resort, was offered to him and accepted (April 14th, 1516). He retained
      his official connection with Glarus, and employed a curate to do his
      parish work. His fame as a preacher grew. His friends desired to see
      him in a larger sphere, and through their exertions he was appointed
      to be people&rsquo;s priest in the Minster at Zurich. An objection had been
      made to his selection on the ground that he had disgracefully wronged
      the daughter of a citizen of Einsiedeln; and his letter of vindication,
      while it exonerates him from the particular charge brought against
      him, shows that he was by no means clear of the laxity in private morals
      which characterised the Swiss clergy of the time. The stipend attached
      to his office in the Great Minster was very small, and on this ground
      Zwingli felt himself justified, unwarrantably, in retaining his papal
      pension.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></p>
<h3>&sect; 4. <i>Zwingli in Zurich.</i></h3>
<p>Zurich, when Zwingli went to it, was an imperial city. It had grown up
      around the Great Minster and the Minster of Our Lady (the Little Minster),
      and had developed into a trading and manufacturing centre. Its citizens,
      probably owing to the ecclesiastical origin of the town, had long engaged
      in quarrels with the clergy, and had generally been successful. They
      took advantage of the rivalries between the heads of the two Minsters
      and the Emperor&rsquo;s bailiff to assert their independence, and had passed
      laws subordinating the ecclesiastical authorities to the secular rule.
      The taxes were levied on ecclesiastical as well as on secular property;
      all the convents were under civic control, and liable to State inspection.
      The popes, anxious to keep on good terms with the Swiss who furnished
      soldiers for their wars, had expressly permitted in Zurich what they
      would not have allowed elsewhere.</p>
<p>The town was ruled by a Council or Senate composed of the Masters of the
      thirteen &ldquo;gilds&rdquo; (twelve trades&rsquo; gilds and one gild representing the
      patriciate). The Burgomaster, with large powers, presided. A great
      Council of 212 members was called together on special occasions.</p>
<p>The city of Zurich, with its thoroughly democratic constitution, was a
      very fitting sphere for a man like Zwingli. He had made a name for
      himself by this time. He had become a powerful preacher, able to stir
      and move the people by his eloquence; he was in intimate relations
      with the more distinguished German Humanists, introduced to them by
      his friend Heinrich Loriti of Glarus (known as Glareanus). He had already
      become the centre of an admiring circle of young men of liberal views.
      His place as people&rsquo;s preacher gave to a man of his popular gifts a
      commanding position in the most democratic town in Switzerland, where
      civic and European politics were eagerly discussed. He went there in
      December 1519.</p>
<p>His work as a Reformer began almost at once. Bernhard Samson or Sanson,
      a seller of indulgences for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg
      30]</a></span> Switzerland, came to Zurich to push his trade. Zwingli
      had already encountered him at Einsiedeln, and, prompted by the Bishop
      of Constance and his vicar-general, John Faber, both of whom disliked
      the indulgences, had preached against him. He now persuaded the Council
      of Zurich to forbid Samson&rsquo;s stay in the town.</p>
<p>The papal treatment of the Swiss Reformer was very different from what
      had been meted out to Luther. Samson received orders from Rome to give
      no trouble to the Zurichers, and to leave the city rather than quarrel
      with them. The difference, no doubt, arose from the desire of the <i>Curia</i> to
      do nothing to hinder the supply of Swiss soldiers for the papal wars;
      but it was also justified by the contrast in the treatment of the subject
      by the two Reformers. Luther struck at a great moral abuse, and his
      strokes cut deeply into the whole round of medi&aelig;val religious
      life, with its doctrine of a special priesthood; he made men see the
      profanity of any claim made by men to pardon sin, or to interfere between
      their fellow-men and God. Zwingli took the whole matter more lightly.
      His position was that of Erasmus and the Humanists. He could laugh
      at and ridicule the whole proceeding, and thought most of the way in
      which men allowed themselves to be gulled and duped by clever knaves.
      He never touched the deep practical religious question which Luther
      raised, and which made his challenge to the Papacy reverberate over
      Western Europe.</p>
<p>From the outset Zwingli became a prominent figure in Zurich. He announced
      to the astonished Chapter of the Great Minster, to whom he owed his
      appointment, that he meant to give a series of continuous expositions
      of the Gospel of St. Matthew; that he would not follow the scholastic
      interpretation of passages in the Gospel, but would endeavour to make
      Scripture its own interpreter. The populace crowded to hear sermons
      of this new kind. In order to reach the country people, Zwingli preached
      in the market-place on the Fridays, and his fame spread throughout
      the villages. The Franciscans, Dominicans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg
      31]</a></span> and Augustinian Eremites tried to arouse opposition,
      but unsuccessfully. In his sermons he denounced sins suggested in the
      passages expounded, and found occasion to deny the doctrines of Purgatory
      and the Intercession of Saints.</p>
<p>His strongest attack on the existing ecclesiastical system was made in
      a sermon on tithes, which, to the distress of the Provost of the Minster,
      he declared to be merely voluntary offerings. (He had been reading
      Hus&rsquo; book <i>On the Church</i>.) He must have carried most of the Chapter
      with him in his schemes for improvement, for in June 1520 the Breviary
      used in the Minster was revised by Zwingli and stripped of some blemishes.
      In the following year (March 1521), some of the Zurichers who were
      known to be among Zwingli&rsquo;s warmest admirers, the printer Froschauer
      among them, asserted their convictions by eating flesh meat publicly
      in Lent. The affair made a great sensation, and the Reformers were
      brought before the Council of the city. They justified themselves by
      declaring that they had only followed the teaching of Zwingli, who
      had shown them that nothing was binding on the consciences of Christians
      which was not commanded in the Scriptures. Zwingli at once undertook
      their defence, and published his sermon, <i>Selection or Liberty concerning
      Foods; an offence and scandal; whether there is any Authority for forbidding
      Meat at certain times</i> (April 16th, 1522). He declared that in such
      matters the responsibility rests with the individual, who may use his
      freedom provided he avoids a public scandal.</p>
<p>The matter was felt to be serious, and the Council, after full debate,
      passed an ordinance which was meant to be a compromise. It was to the
      effect that although the New Testament makes no rule on the subject,
      fasting in Lent is a very ancient custom, and must not be set aside
      until dealt with by authority, and that the priests of the three parishes
      of Zurich were to dissuade the people from all violation of the ordinance.</p>
<p>The Bishop of Constance thereupon interfered, and sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg
                  32]</a></span> a Commission, consisting of his suffragan
                  and two others, to investigate and report. They met the
                  Small Council, and in a long address insisted that the
                  Church had authority in such matters, and that the usages
                  it commanded must be obeyed. Zwingli appeared before the
                  Great Council, and, in spite of the efforts of the Commission
                  to keep him silent, argued in defence of liberty of conscience.
                  In the end the Council resolved to abide by its compromise,
                  but asked the Bishop of Constance to hold a Synod of his
                  clergy and come to a resolution upon the matter which would
                  be in accordance with the law of Christ. This resolution
                  of the Council really set aside the episcopal authority,
                  and was a revolt against the Roman Church.</p>
<p>Political affairs favoured the rebellion. At the Swiss Diet held at Luzern
      (May 1521), the cantons, in spite of the vehement remonstrances of
      Zurich, made a treaty with France, and allowed the French king to recruit
      a force of 16,000 Swiss mercenaries. Zurich, true to its protest, refused
      to allow recruiting within its lands. Its citizens chafed at the loss
      of money and the separation from the other cantons, and Zwingli became
      very unpopular. He had now made up his mind that the whole system of
      pensions and mercenary service was wrong, and had resigned his own
      papal pension. Just then the Pope asked Zurich, which supplied him
      with half of his bodyguard, for a force of soldiers to be used in defence
      of his States, promising that they would not be used to fight the French,
      among whose troops were many Swiss mercenaries from other cantons.
      The Council refused. Nevertheless, six thousand Zurichers set out to
      join the papal army. The Council recalled them, and after some adventures,
      in one of which they narrowly escaped fighting with the Swiss mercenaries
      in the service of France, they returned home. This expedition, which
      brought neither money nor honour to the Zurichers, turned the tide
      of popular feeling, and the Council forbade all foreign service. When
      the long connection between Zurich and the Papacy is considered, this
      decree was virtually a breach between the city and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg
      33]</a></span> Pope. It made the path of the Reformation much easier
      (Jan. 1522), and Zwingli&rsquo;s open break with the Papacy was only a matter
      of time.</p>
<p>It came with the publication of the <i>Archeteles</i> (August 1522), a
      book hastily written, like all Zwingli&rsquo;s works, which contained a defence
      of all that he had done, and a programme, ecclesiastical and political,
      for the future. The book increased the zeal of Zwingli&rsquo;s opponents.
      His sermons were often interrupted by monks and others instigated by
      them. The burgomaster was compelled to interfere in order to maintain
      the peace of the town. He issued an order on his own authority, without
      any appeal to the Bishop of Constance, that the pure Word of God was
      to be preached. At an assembly of the country clergy of the canton,
      the same decision was reached; and town and clergy were ready to move
      along the path of reformation. Shortly before this (July 2nd), Zwingli
      and ten other priests petitioned the bishop to permit his clergy to
      contract legal marriages. The document had no practical effect, save
      to show the gradual advance of ideas. It disclosed the condition of
      things that sacerdotal celibacy had produced in Switzerland.</p>
<h3>&sect; 5. <i>The Public Disputations</i>.</h3>
<p>In these circumstances, the Great Council, now definitely on Zwingli&rsquo;s
      side, resolved to hold a Public Disputation to settle the controversies
      in religion; and Zwingli drafted sixty-seven theses to be discussed.
      These articles contain a summary of his doctrinal teaching. They insist
      that the Word of God, the only rule of faith, is to be received upon
      its own authority and not on that of the Church. They are very full
      of Christ, the only Saviour, the true Son of God, who has redeemed
      us from eternal death and reconciled us to God. They attack the Primacy
      of the Pope, the Mass, the Invocation of the Saints, the thought that
      men can acquire merit by their good works, Fasts, Pilgrimages, and
      Purgatory. Of sacerdotal celibacy he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg
      34]</a></span> says, &ldquo;<i>I know of no greater nor graver scandal than
      that which forbids lawful marriage to priests, and yet permits them
      on payment of money to have concubines and harlots. Fie for shame!</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The
      theses consist of single short sentences.</p>
<p>The Disputation, the first of the four which marked the stages of the
      legal Reformation in Zurich, was held in the Town Hall of the city
      on January 29th, 1523. More than six hundred representative men gathered
      to hear it. All the clergy of the canton were present; Faber watched
      the proceedings on behalf of the Bishop of Constance; many distinguished
      divines from other parts of Switzerland were present. Faber seems to
      have contented himself with asking that the Disputation should be delayed
      until a General Council should meet, and Zwingli replied that competent
      scholars who were good Christians were as able as a Council to decide
      what was the meaning of the Holy Scriptures. The result of the Disputation
      was that the burgomaster declared that Zwingli had justified his teaching,
      and that he was no heretic. The canton of Zurich practically adopted
      Zwingli&rsquo;s views, and the Reformer was encouraged to proceed further.</p>
<p>His course of conduct was eminently prudent. He invariably took pains
      to educate the people up to further changes by explaining them carefully
      in sermons, and by publishing and circulating these discourses. He
      considered that it was his duty to teach, but that it belonged to the
      civic authorities to make the changes; and he himself made none until
      they were authorised. He had very strong views against the use of images
      in churches, and had preached vigorously against their presence. Some
      of his more ardent hearers began to deface the statues and pictures.
      The Great Council accordingly took the whole question into consideration,
      and decided that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg
      35]</a></span> second Public Disputation should be held, at which the
      matter might be publicly discussed. This discussion (October 1523)
      lasted for two days. More than eight hundred persons were present,
      of whom three hundred and fifty were clergy. On the first day, Zwingli
      set forth his views on the presence of images in churches, and wished
      their use forbidden. The Council decided that the statues and pictures
      should be removed from the churches, but without disturbance; the rioters
      were to be pardoned, but their leader was to be banished from the city
      for two years. The second day&rsquo;s subject of conference was the Mass.
      Zwingli pled that the Mass was not a sacrifice, but a memorial of the
      death of our Lord, and urged that the abuses surrounding the simple
      Christian rite should be swept away. The presence of Anabaptists at
      this conference, and their expressions in debate, warned the magistrates
      that they must proceed cautiously, and they contented themselves with
      appointing a commission of eight&mdash;two from the Council and six
      clergymen&mdash;to inquire and report. Meanwhile the clergy were to
      be informed how to act, and the letter of instruction was to be written
      by Zwingli. The authorities also deputed preachers to go to the outlying
      parts of the canton and explain the whole matter carefully to the people.</p>
<p>The letter which Zwingli addressed to the clergy of Zurich canton is a
      brief statement of Reformation principles. It is sometimes called the <i>Instruction</i>.
      Zwingli entitles it, <i>A brief Christian Introduction which the Honourable
      Council of the city of Zurich has sent to the pastors and preachers
      living in its cities, lands, and wherever its authority extends, so
      that they may henceforth in unison announce and preach the gospel.</i><a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> It
      describes sin, the law, God&rsquo;s way of salvation, and then goes on to
      speak of images. Zwingli&rsquo;s argument is that the presence of statues
      and pictures in churches has led to idolatry, and that they ought to
      be removed. The concluding section discusses the Mass.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg
      36]</a></span> Here the author states very briefly what he elaborated
      afterwards, that the main thought in the Eucharist is not the repetition
      of the sacrifice of Christ, but its faithful remembrance, and that
      the Romish doctrine and ceremony of the Mass has been so corrupted
      to superstitious uses that it ought to be thoroughly reformed.</p>
<p>This letter had a marked effect. The village priests everywhere refused
      to say Mass according to the old ritual. But there was a section of
      the people, including members of the chapter of the Minster, who shrunk
      from changes in this central part of Christian worship. In deference
      to their feelings, the Council resolved that the Holy Supper should
      be meanwhile dispensed according to both the Reformed and the medi&aelig;val
      rite; in the one celebration the cup was given to the laity, and in
      the other it was withheld. No change was made in the liturgy. Then
      came a third conference, and a fourth; and at last the Mass was abolished.
      On April 13th, 1525, the first Evangelical communion service took place
      in the Great Minster, and the medi&aelig;val worship was at an end.
      Other changes had been made. The monasteries had been secularised,
      and the monks who did not wish to leave their calling were all gathered
      together in the Franciscan convent. An amicable arrangement was come
      to about other ecclesiastical foundations, and the money thus secured
      was mainly devoted to education.</p>
<p>From 1522, Zwingli had been living in &ldquo;clerical&rdquo;
      marriage with Anna Reinhard, the widow of a wealthy Zurich burgher.
            She was called his wife by his friends, although no legal marriage
            ceremony had been performed. It is perhaps difficult for us to
            judge the man and the times. The so-called &ldquo;clerical&rdquo; marriages
            were universal in Switzerland. Man and woman took each other
            for husband and wife, and were faithful. There was no public
            ceremony. All questions of marriage, divorce, succession, and
            so forth, were then adjudicated in the ecclesiastical and not
            in the civil courts; and as the Canon Law had insisted that no
            clergyman could marry, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg
            37]</a></span> such &ldquo;clerical&rdquo; marriages were simple concubinage
            in the eye of the law, and the children were illegitimate. The
            offence against the vow of chastity was condoned by a fine paid
            to the bishop. As early as 1523, William R&ouml;ubli, a Zurich
            priest, went through a public form of marriage, and his example
            was followed by others; but it may be questioned whether these
            marriages were recognised to be legal until Zurich passed its
            own laws about matrimonial cases in 1525.</p>
<p>Luther in his pure-hearted and solemnly sympathetic way had referred to
      these clerical marriages in his <i>Address to the Christian Nobility
      of the German Nation</i> (1520).</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;We see,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;how the priesthood is fallen, and how many a
            poor priest is encumbered with a woman and children, and burdened
            in his conscience, and no man does anything to help him, though
            he might very well be helped.... I will not conceal my honest
            counsel, nor withhold comfort from that unhappy crowd, who now
            live in trouble with wife and children, and remain in shame,
            with a heavy conscience, hearing their wife called a priest&rsquo;s
            harlot and the children bastards.... I say that these two (who
            are minded in their hearts to live together always in conjugal
            fidelity) are surely married before God.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He had never succumbed to the temptations of the flesh, and had kept his
      body and soul pure; and for that very reason he could sympathise with
      and help by his sympathy those who had fallen. Zwingli, on the other
      hand, had deliberately contracted this illicit alliance after he had
      committed himself to the work of a Reformer. The action remains a permanent
      blot on his character, and places him on a different level from Luther
      and from Calvin. It has been already noted that Zwingli had always
      an intellectual rather than a spiritual appreciation of the need of
      reformation,&mdash;that he was much more of a Humanist than either
      Luther or Calvin,&mdash;but what is remarkable is that we have distinct
      evidence that the need of personal piety had impressed itself on him
      during these years, and that he passed through a religious crisis,
      slight compared with that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg
      38]</a></span> of Luther, but real so far as it went. He fell ill of
      the plague (Sept.-Nov. 1519), and the vision of death and recovery
      drew from him some hymns of resignation and thanksgiving.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The
      death of his brother Andrew (Nov. 1520) seems to have been the real
      turning-point in his inward spiritual experience, and his letters and
      writings are evidence of its reality and permanence. Perhaps the judgment
      which a contemporary and friend, Martin Bucer, passed ought to content
      us:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;When I read your letter to Capito, that you had made public announcement
            of your marriage, I was almost beside myself in my satisfaction.
            For it was the one thing I desired for you.... I never believed
            you were unmarried after the time when you indicated to the Bishop
            of Constance in that tract that you desired this gift. But as
            I considered the fact that you were thought to be a fornicator
            by some, and by others held to have little faith in Christ, I
            could not understand why you concealed it so long, and that the
            fact was not declared openly, and with candour and diligence.
            I could not doubt that you were led into this course by considerations
            which could not be put aside by a conscientious man. However
            that may be, I triumph in the fact that now you have come up
            in all things to the apostolic definition.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Reformation was spreading beyond Zurich. Evangelical preachers had
      arisen in many of the other cantons, and were gaining adherents.</p>
<h3>&sect; 6. <i>The Reformation outside Zurich</i>.</h3>
<p>Basel, the seat of a famous university and a centre of German Humanism,
      contained many scholars who had come under the influence of Thomas
      Wyttenbach, Zwingli&rsquo;s teacher. Wolfgang Fabricius Capito, a disciple
      of Erasmus, a learned student of the Scriptures, had begun as early
      as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> 1512
      to show how the ceremonies and many of the usages of the Church had
      no authority from the Bible. He worked in Basel from 1512 to 1520.
      Johannes Oecolampadius (Hussgen or Heusgen), who had been one of Luther&rsquo;s
      supporters in 1521, came to Basel in 1522 as Lecturer on the Holy Scriptures
      in the University. His lectures and his sermons to the townspeople
      caused such a movement that the bishop forbade their delivery. The
      citizens asked for a Public Disputation. Two held in the month of December
      1524&mdash;the one conducted by a priest of the name of St&ouml;r against
      clerical celibacy, and the other led by William Farel<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>&mdash;raised
      the courage of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg
      40]</a></span> Evangelical party. In February 1525 the Council of the
      town installed Oecolampadius as the preacher in St. Martin&rsquo;s Church,
      and authorised him to make such changes as the Word of God demanded.
      This was the beginning. Oecolampadius became a firm friend of Zwingli&rsquo;s,
      and they worked together.</p>
<p>In Bern also the Reformation made progress. Berthold Haller<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and
      Sebastian Meyer<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> preached
      the Gospel with courage for several years, and were upheld by the painter
      Nicolaus Manuel, who had great influence with the citizens. The Council
      decided to permit freedom in preaching, if in accordance with the Word
      of God; but they refused to permit innovations in worship or ceremonies;
      and they forbade the introduction of heretical books into the town.
      The numbers of the Evangelical party increased rapidly, and in the
      beginning of 1527 they had a majority in both the great and the small
      Councils. It was then decided to have a Public Disputation.</p>
<p>The occasion was one of the most momentous in the history of the Reformation
      in Switzerland. Hitherto Zurich had stood alone; if Bern joined, the
      two most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> powerful
      cantons in Switzerland would be able to hold their own. There was need
      for union. The Forest cantons had been uttering threats, and Zwingli&rsquo;s
      life was not secure. Bern was fully alive to the importance of the
      proposed discussion, and was resolved to make it as imposing as possible,
      and that the disputants on both sides should receive fair play and
      feel themselves in perfect freedom and safety. They sent special invitations
      to the four bishops whose dioceses entered their territories&mdash;the
      Bishops of Constance, Basel, Valais, and Lausanne; and they did their
      best to assemble a sufficient number of learned Romanist theologians.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> They
      promised not only safe-conducts, but the escort of a herald to and
      from the canton.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> It
      soon became evident, however, that the Romanist partisans had no great
      desire to come to the <i>Disputation</i>. None of the bishops invited
      appears to have even thought of being present save the Bishop of Lausanne,
      and he found reasons for declining.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The <i>Disputation</i> was
      viewed with anxiety by the Romanist partisans, and in a letter sent
      from Speyer (December 28th) the Emperor Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span> strongly
      remonstrated with the magistrates of Bern.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> The
      Bernese were not to be intimidated. They issued their invitations,
      and made every arrangement to give &eacute;clat to the great Disputation.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Berthold
      Haller, with the help of Zwingli, had drafted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg
      42]</a></span> ten <i>Theses</i>, which were to be defended by himself
      and his colleague, Francis Kolb; Zwingli had translated them into Latin
      and Farel into French for the benefit of strangers; and they were sent
      out with the invitations. They were&mdash;(1) The Holy Catholic Church,
      of which Christ is the only Head, is born of the Word of God, abides
      therein, and does not hear the voice of a stranger.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> (2)
      The Church of Christ makes no law nor statute apart from the Word of
      God, and consequently those human ordinances which are called the commandments
      of the Church do not bind our consciences unless they are founded on
      the Word of God and agreeable thereto. (3) Christ is our wisdom, righteousness,
      redemption, and price for the sins of the whole world; and all who
      think they can win salvation in any other way, or have other satisfaction
      for their sins, renounce Christ. (4) It is impossible to prove from
      Scripture that the Body and Blood of Christ are corporeally present
      in the bread of the Holy Supper. (5) The Mass, in which Christ is offered
      to God the Father for the sins of the living and the dead, is contrary
      to the Holy Scripture, is a gross affront to the Passion and Death
      of Christ, and is therefore an abomination before God. (6) Since Christ
      alone died for us, and since He is the only mediator and intercessor
      between God and believers, He only ought to be invoked; and all other
      mediators and advocates ought to be rejected, since they have no warrant
      in the Holy Scripture of the Bible. (7) There is no trace of Purgatory
      after death in the Bible; and therefore all services for the dead,
      such as vigils, Masses, and the like, are vain things. (8) To make
      pictures and adore them is contrary to the Old and New Testament, and
      they ought to be destroyed where there is the chance that they may
      be adored. (9) Marriage is not forbidden to any estate by the Holy
      Scripture, but wantonness and fornication are forbidden to everyone
      in whatever estate he may be. (10) The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg
      43]</a></span> fornicator is truly excommunicated by the Holy Scripture,
      and therefore wantonness and fornication are much more scandalous among
      the clergy than in the other estate.</p>
<p>These <i>Theses</i> represent in succinct fashion the preaching in the
      Reformed Church in Switzerland, and the fourth states in its earliest
      form what grew to be the Zwinglian doctrine of the Holy Supper.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>
<p>The Council of Bern had sent invitations to be present to the leading
      preachers in the Evangelical cities of Germany and Switzerland. Bucer
      and Capito came from Strassburg, Jacob Augsburger from M&uuml;hlhausen,
      Ambrose Blaarer from Constance, Sebastian Wagner,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> surnamed
      Hofmeister (&#338;conomus), from Schaffhausen, Oecolampadius from Basel,
      and many others.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Zwingli&rsquo;s
      arrival was eagerly expected. The Zurichers were resolved not to trust
      their leader away from the city without a strong guard, and sent him
      to Bern with an escort of three hundred men-at-arms. A great crowd
      of citizens and strangers filled the arcades which line both sides
      of the main street, and every window in the many-storied houses had
      its sightseers to watch the Zurichers tramping up from gate to cathedral
      with their pastor safe in the centre of the troop.</p>
<p>Romanist theologians did not muster in anything like the same strength.
      The men of the four Forest cantons stood sullenly aloof; the authorities
      in French-speaking Switzerland had no liking for the Disputation, and
      the strongly Romanist canton of Freiburg did its best to prevent the
      theologians of Neuch&acirc;tel, Morat, and Grandson from appearing
      at Bern; but in spite of the hindrances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg
      44]</a></span> placed in their way no less than three hundred and fifty
      ecclesiastics gathered to the Disputation. The conference was opened
      on January 15th (<i>le dimenche apr&egrave;s la feste de la circuncision</i>),<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and
      was continued in German till the 24th; on the 25th a second discussion,
      lasting two days, was begun, for the benefit of strangers, in Latin. &ldquo;When <i>la
      Dispute des Welches</i> (strangers) was opened, a stranger doctor (of
      Paris) came forward along with some priests speaking the same language
      as himself. He attacked the <i>Ten Theses</i>, and William Farel, preacher
      at Aigle, answered him.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The
      more distinguished Romanist theologians who were present seem to have
      refrained from taking part in the discussion. The Bishop of Lausanne
      defended their silence on the grounds that they objected to discuss
      such weighty matters in the vulgar tongue; that no opportunity was
      given to them to speak in Latin; and that when the Emperor had interdicted
      the Disputation they were told by the authorities of Bern that they
      might leave the city if it so pleased them.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>
<p>The result of the Disputation was that the authorities and citizens of
      Bern were confirmed in their resolve to adopt the Reformation. The
      Disputation ended on the 26th of January (1528), and on the 7th of
      February the Mass was declared to be abolished, and a sermon took its
      place; images were removed from the churches; the monasteries were
      secularised, and the funds were used partly for education and partly
      to make up for the French and papal pensions, which were now definitely
      renounced, and declared to be illegal.</p>
<p>The two sermons which Zwingli preached in the cathedral during the Disputation
      made a powerful impression on the people of Bern. It was after one
      of them that M. de Watteville, the Advoyer or President of the Republic,
      declared himself to be convinced of the truth of the Evangelical faith,
      and with his whole family accepted the Reformation. His eldest son,
      a clergyman whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg
      45]</a></span> family interest had procured for him no less than thirteen
      benefices, and who, it was commonly supposed, would be the next Bishop
      of Lausanne, renounced them all to live the life of a simple country
      gentleman.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>
<p>The republic of Bern for long regarded the <i>Ten Theses</i> as the charter
      of its religious faith. Not content with declaring the Reformation
      legally established within the city, the authorities of Bern sent despatches
      or delegates to all the cities and lands under their control, informing
      them of what they had done, and inviting them to follow their example.
      They insisted that preachers of the Gospel must be at liberty to deliver
      their message without interruption throughout all their territories.
      They promised that they would maintain the liberty of both cults until
      means had been taken to find out which the majority of the inhabitants
      preferred, and that the decision would be taken by vote in presence
      of commissioners sent down from Bern.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> When
      the majority of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg
      46]</a></span> the parishioners accepted the Reformation, the new doctrinal
      standard was the <i>Ten Theses</i>, and the Council of Bern sent directions
      for the method of dispensing the Sacraments of Baptism and the Lord&rsquo;s
      Supper, and for the solemnisation of marriages. The whole of the German-speaking
      portion of the canton proper and its dependences seem to have accepted
      the Reformation at once. Bern had, besides, some French-speaking districts
      under its own exclusive control, and others over which it ruled along
      with Freiburg. The progress of the new doctrines was slower in these
      district, but it may be said that they had all embraced the Reformation
      before the end of 1530. The history of the Reformation in French-speaking
      Switzerland belongs, however, to the next chapter, and the efforts
      of Bern to evangelise its subjects in these districts will be described
      there.</p>
<p>Not content with this, the Council of Bern constituted itself the patron
      and protector of persecuted Protestants outside their own lands, and
      the evangelisation of western Switzerland owed almost everything to
      its fostering care.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>
<p>Thus Bern in the west and Zurich in the east stood forth side by side
      pledged to the Reformation.</p>
<p>The cantonal authorities of Appenzell had declared, as early as 1524,
      that Gospel preaching was to have free course within their territories.
      Thomas Wyttenbach had been people&rsquo;s priest in Biel from 1507, and had
      leavened the town with his Evangelical preaching. In 1524 he courageously
      married. The ecclesiastical authorities were strong enough to get him
      deposed; but a year or two later the citizens compelled the cantonal
      Council to permit the free preaching of the Gospel. Sebastian Hofmeister
      preached in Schaffhausen, and induced its people to declare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg
      47]</a></span> for the Reformation. St. Gallen was evangelised by the
      Humanist Joachim von Watt (Vadianus), and by John Kessler, who had
      studied at Wittenberg. In German Switzerland only Luzern and the Forest
      cantons remained completely and immovably attached to the Roman Church,
      and refused to tolerate any Evangelical preaching within their borders.
      The Swiss Confederacy was divided ecclesiastically into two opposite
      camps.</p>
<p>The strong religious differences could not but affect the political cohesion
      of the Swiss Confederacy, linked together as it was by ties comparatively
      slight. The wonder is that they did not altogether destroy it.</p>
<p>As early as 1522, the Bishop of Constance had asked the Swiss Federal
      Diet at their meeting at Baden to prohibit the preaching of the Reformation
      doctrines within the Federation; and the next year the Diet, which
      met again at Baden (Sept. 1523), issued a declaration that all who
      practised religious innovations were worthy of punishment. The deputies
      from Luzern were especially active in inducing the Diet to pass this
      resolution. The attempt to use the Federation for the purpose of religious
      persecution, therefore, first came from the Romanist side. Nor did
      they content themselves with declarations in the Diet. The Romanist
      canton of Unterwalden, being informed that some of the peasants in
      the Bernese Oberland had complained that the Reformation had been forced
      upon them, crossed the Bernese frontier and committed an act of war.
      Bern smarted under the insult.</p>
<p>These endeavours on the part of his opponents led Zwingli to meditate
      on plans for leaguing together for the purposes of mutual defence all
      who had accepted the Reformation. His plans from the first went beyond
      the Swiss Confederacy.</p>
<p>The imperial city of Constance, the seat of the diocese which claimed
      ecclesiastical authority over Zurich, had been mightily moved by the
      preaching of Ambrose Blaarer, and had come over to the Protestant faith.
      The bishop retired to Meersburg and his chapter to Ueberlingen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg
      48]</a></span> The city feared the attack of Austria, and craved protection
      from the Swiss Protestants. Its alliance was valuable to them, for,
      along with Lindau, it commanded the whole Lake of Constance. Zurich
      thereupon asked that Constance be admitted within the Swiss Federation.
      This was refused by the Federal Diet (Nov. 1527). Zurich then entered
      into a <i>Christian Civic League</i> (<i>das christliche B&uuml;rgerrecht</i>)
      with Constance,&mdash;a league based on their common religious beliefs,&mdash;promising
      to defend each other if attacked. The example once set was soon followed,
      and the two following years saw the League increasing rapidly. Bern
      joined in June 1528, St. Gallen in Nov. 1528, Biel in January, M&uuml;hlhausen
      in February, Basel in March, and Schaffhausen in October, 1529. Strassburg
      was admitted in January 1530. Even Hesse and W&uuml;rtemburg washed
      to join. Bern and Zurich came to an agreement that Evangelical preaching
      must be allowed in the Common Lands, and that no one was to be punished
      for his religious opinions.</p>
<p>The combination looked so threatening and contained such possibilities
      that Ferdinand of Austria proposed a counter-league among the Romanist
      cantons; and a <i>Christian Union</i>, in which Luzern, Zug, Schwyz,
      Uri, and Unterwalden allied themselves with the Duchy of Austria, was
      founded in 1529, having for its professed objects the preservation
      of the medi&aelig;val religion, with some reforms carried out under
      the guidance of the ecclesiastical authorities. The Confederates pledged
      themselves to secure for each other the right to punish heretics. This
      League had also its possibilities of extension. It was thought that
      Bavaria and Salzburg might join. The canton of the Valais had already
      leagued itself with Savoy against Geneva, and brought its ally within
      the <i>Christian Union</i>. The very formation of the Leagues threatened
      war, and occasions of hostilities were not lacking. Austria was eager
      to attack Constance, and Bern longed to punish Unterwalden for its
      unprovoked invasion of Bernese territory. The condition and protection
      of the Evangelical population in the Common Lands and in the Free Bailiwicks
      demanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> settlement,
      more especially as the Romanist cantons had promised to support each
      other in asserting their right to punish heretics. War seemed to be
      inevitable. Schaffhausen, Appenzell, and the Graub&uuml;nden endeavoured
      to mediate; but as neither Zurich nor Bern would listen to any proposals
      which did not include the right of free preaching, their efforts were
      in vain. The situation, difficult enough, was made worse by the action
      of the canton of Schwyz, which, having caught a Zurich pastor named
      Kaiser on its territory, had him condemned and burnt as a heretic.
      This was the signal for war. It was agreed that the Zurichers should
      attack the Romanist cantons, while Bern defended the Common Lands,
      and, if need be, the territory of her sister canton. The plan of campaign
      was drafted by Zwingli himself, who also laid down the conditions of
      peace. His proposals were, that the Forest cantons must allow the free
      preaching of the Gospel within their lands; that they were to forswear
      pensions from any external Power, and that all who received them should
      be punished both corporeally and by fine; that the alliance with Austria
      should be given up; and that a war indemnity should be paid to Zurich
      and to Bern. While the armies were facing each other the Zurichers
      received a strong appeal from Hans Oebli, the Landamann of Glarus,
      to listen to the proposals of the enemy. The common soldiers disliked
      the internecine strife. They looked upon each other as brothers, and
      the outposts of both armies were fraternising. In these circumstances
      the Zurich army (for it was the Swiss custom that the armies on the
      field concluded treaties) accepted the terms of peace offered by their
      opponents. The treaty is known as the First Peace of Kappel (June 1529).
      It provided that the alliance between Austria and the Romanist cantons
      should be dissolved, and the treaties &ldquo;pierced and slit&rdquo; (the parchments
      were actually cut in pieces by the dagger in sight of all); that in
      the Common Lands no one was to be persecuted for his religious opinions;
      that the majority should decide whether the old faith was to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg
      50]</a></span> retained or not, and that bailiffs of moderate opinions
      should be sent to rule them; that neither party should attack the other
      because of religion; that a war indemnity should be paid by the Romanist
      cantons to Zurich and Bern (the amount was fixed at 2500 Sonnenkronen);
      and that the abolition of foreign pensions and mercenary service should
      be recommended to Luzern and the Forest cantons. The treaty contained
      the seeds of future war; for the Zurichers believed that they had secured
      the right of free preaching within the Romanist cantons, while these
      cantons believed that they had been left to regulate their own internal
      economy as they pleased. Zwingli would have preferred a settlement
      after war, and the future justified his apprehensions.</p>
<p>Three months after the First Peace of Kappel, Zwingli was summoned to
      the Marburg Colloquy, and the Reformation in Switzerland became inevitably
      connected with the wider sphere of German ecclesiastical politics.
      It may be well, however, to reserve this until later, and finish the
      internal history of the Swiss movement.</p>
<p>The First Peace of Kappel was only a truce, and left both parties irritated
      with each other. The friction was increased when the Protestants discovered
      that the Romanist cantons would not admit free preaching within their
      territories. They also shrewdly suspected that, despite the tearing
      and burning of the documents, the understanding with Austria was still
      maintained. An event occurred which seemed to justify their suspicions.
      An Italian condottiere, Giovanni Giacomo de&rsquo; Medici, had seized and
      held (1525-31) the strong position called the Rocco di Musso on the
      Lake of Como, and from this stronghold he dominated the whole lake.
      This ruffian had murdered Martin Paul and his son, envoys from the
      Graub&uuml;nden to Milan, and had crossed the lake and harried the
      fertile valley of the Adda, known as the Val Tellina, which was then
      within the territories of the Graub&uuml;nden (Grisons). The Swiss
      Confederacy were bound to defend their neighbours; but when appeal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg
      51]</a></span> was made, the Romanist cantons refused, and the hand
      of Austria was seen behind the refusal. Besides, at the Federal Diets
      the Romanist cantons had refused to listen to any complaints of persecutions
      for religion within their lands. At a meeting between Zurich and her
      allies, it was resolved that the Romanist cantons should be compelled
      to abolish the system of foreign pensions, and permit free preaching
      within their territories. Zurich was for open war, but the advice of
      Bern prevailed. It was resolved that if the Romanist cantons would
      not agree to these proposals, Zurich and her allies should prevent
      wine, wheat, salt, and iron from passing through their territories
      to the Forest cantons. The result was that the Forest cantons declared
      war, invaded Zurich while that canton was unprepared, fought and won
      the battle of Kappel, at which Zwingli was slain. He had accompanied
      the little army of Zurich as its chaplain. The victory of the Romanists
      produced a Second Peace of Kappel which reversed the conditions of
      the first. War indemnities were exacted from most of the Protestant
      cantons. It was settled that each canton was to be left free to manage
      its own religious affairs; that the <i>Christian Civic League</i> was
      to be dissolved; and a number of particular provisions were made which
      practically secured the rights of Romanist without corresponding advantages
      to Protestant minorities. The territories of Zurich were left untouched,
      but the city was compelled by the charter of Kappel to grant rights
      to her rural districts. She bound herself to consult them in all important
      matters, and particularly not to make war or peace without their consent.</p>
<p>As a result of this ruinous defeat, and of the death of Zwingli which
      accompanied it, Zurich lost her place as the leading Protestant canton,
      and the guidance of the Reformation movement fell more and more into
      the hands of Geneva, which was an ally but not a member of the Confederation.
      Another and more important permanent result of this Second Peace of
      Kappel was that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg
      52]</a></span> seen in Switzerland as in Germany that while the Reformation
      could not be destroyed, it could not win for itself the whole country,
      and that Roman Catholics and Protestants must divide the cantons and
      endeavour to live peaceably side by side.</p>
<p>The history of the Reformation in Switzerland after the death of Zwingli
      is so linked with the wider history of the movement in Germany and
      in Geneva, that it can scarcely be spoken about separately. It is also
      intimately related to the differences which separated Zwingli from
      Luther in the doctrine of the Sacrament of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper.</p>
<h3>&sect; 7. <i>The Sacramental Controversy.</i><a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></h3>
<p>In the Bern Disputation of 1528, the fourth thesis said &ldquo;it cannot be
      proved from the Scripture that the Body and Blood of Christ are substantially
      and corporeally received in the Eucharist,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and
      the statement became a distinctive watchword of the early Swiss Reformation.
      This thesis, a negative one, was perhaps the earliest official statement
      of a bold attempt to get rid of the priestly miracle in the Mass, which
      was the strongest theoretical and practical obstacle to the acceptance
      of the fundamental Protestant thought of the spiritual priesthood of
      all believers. The question had been seriously exercising the attention
      of all the leading theologians of the Reformation, and this very trenchant
      way of dismissing it had suggested itself simultaneously to theologians
      in the Low Countries, in the district of the Upper Rhine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg
      53]</a></span> and in many of the imperial cities. It had been proclaimed
      in all its naked simplicity by Andrew Bodenstein of Carlstadt, the
      theologian of the German democracy; but it was Zwingli who worked at
      the subject carefully, and who had produced a reasonable if somewhat
      defective theory based on a rather shallow exegesis, in which the words
      of our Lord, &ldquo;This <i>is</i> My Body,&rdquo; were declared to mean nothing
      but &ldquo;This <i>signifies</i> My Body.&rdquo;
      Luther, always disposed to think harshly of anything that came from
      Carlstadt, inclined to exaggerate his influence with the German Protestant
      democracy, believing with his whole heart that in the Sacrament of
      the Holy Supper the elements Bread and Wine were more than the bare
      signs of the Body and Blood of the Lord, was vehemently moved to find
      such views concerning a central doctrine of Christianity spreading
      through his beloved Germany. He never paused to ask whether the opinions
      he saw adopted with eagerness in most of the imperial cities were really
      different from those of Carlstadt (for that is one of the sad facts
      in this deplorable controversy). He simply denounced them, and stormed
      against Zwingli, whose name was spread abroad as their author and propagator.
      N&uuml;rnberg was almost the only great city that remained faithful
      to him. It was the only city also which was governed by the ancient
      patriciate, and in which the democracy had little or no power. When
      van Hoen and Karl Stadt in the Netherlands, Hedio at Mainz, Conrad
      Sam at Ulm, when the preachers of Augsburg, Strassburg, Frankfurt,
      Reutlingen, and other cities accepted and taught Zwingli&rsquo;s doctrine
      of the Eucharist, Luther and his immediate circle saw a great deal
      more than a simple division in doctrine. It was something more than
      the meaning of the Holy Supper or the exegesis of a difficult text
      which rent Protestantism in two, and made Luther and Zwingli appear
      as the leaders of opposing parties in a movement where union was a
      supreme necessity after the decision at Speyer in 1529. The theological
      question was complicated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg
      54]</a></span> social and political ideas, which, if not acknowledged
      openly, were at least in the minds of the leaders who took sides in
      the dispute. On the one side were men whom Luther held to be in part
      responsible for the Peasants&rsquo; War, who were the acknowledged leaders
      of that democracy which he had learnt to distrust if not to fear, who
      still wished to link the Reformation to vast political schemes, all
      of which tended to weaken the imperial power by means of French and
      other alliances, and who only added to their other iniquities a theological
      theory which, he honestly believed, would take away from believers
      their comforting assurance of union with their Lord in the Sacrament
      of the Holy Supper.</p>
<p>The real theological difference after all did not amount to so much as
      is generally said. Zwingli&rsquo;s doctrine of the Holy Supper was not the
      crude theory of Carlstadt; and Luther might have seen this if he had
      only fairly examined it. The opposed views were, in fact, complementary,
      and the pronounced ideas of each were implicitly, though not expressly,
      held by the other. Luther and Zwingli approached the subject from two
      different points of view, and in debate they neither understood nor
      were exactly facing each other.</p>
<p>The whole Christian Church, during all the centuries, has found three
      great ideas embodied in the Sacrament of the Holy Supper, and all three
      have express reference to the death of the Saviour on the Cross for
      His people. The thoughts are Proclamation, Commemoration, and Participation
      or Communion. In the Supper, believers proclaim the death and what
      it means; they commemorate the Sacrifice; and they partake in or have
      communion with the crucified Christ, who is also the Risen Saviour.
      The medi&aelig;val Church had insisted that this sacramental union
      with Christ was in the hands of the priesthood to give or to withhold.
      Duly ordained priests, and they alone, could bring the worshippers
      into such a relation with Christ as would make the Sacramental participation
      a possible thing: and out of this claim had grown the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg
      55]</a></span> medi&aelig;val theory of Transubstantiation. It had
      also divided the Sacrament of the Supper into two distinct rites (the
      phrase is not too strong)&mdash;the Mass and the Eucharist&mdash;the
      one connecting itself instinctively with the commemoration and the
      other with the participation.</p>
<p>Protestants united in denying the special priestly miracle needed to bring
      Christ and His people together in the Sacrament; but it is easy to
      see that they might approach the subject by the two separate paths
      of Mass or Eucharist. Zwingli took the one road and Luther happened
      on the other.</p>
<p>Zwingli believed that the medi&aelig;val Church had displaced the scriptural
      thought of <i>commemoration</i>, and put the non-scriptural idea of <i>repetition</i> in
      its place. For the medi&aelig;val priest claimed that in virtue of
      the miraculous power given in ordination, he could really change the
      bread and wine into the actual physical Body of Jesus, and, when this
      was done, that he could reproduce over again the agony of the Cross
      by crushing it with his teeth. This idea seemed to Zwingli to be utterly
      profane; it dishonoured the One great Sacrifice; it was unscriptural;
      it depended on a priestly gift of working a miracle which did not exist.
      Then he believed that the sixth chapter of St. John&rsquo;s Gospel forbade
      all thought that spiritual benefits could come from a mere partaking
      with the mouth. It was the atonement worked out by Christ&rsquo;s death that
      was appropriated and commemorated in the Holy Supper; and the atonement
      is always received by faith. Thus the two principal thoughts in the
      theory of Zwingli are, that the medi&aelig;val doctrine must be purified
      by changing the idea of repetition of the death of Christ for commemoration
      of that death, and the thought of manducating with the teeth for that
      of faith which is the faculty by which spiritual benefits are received.
      But Zwingli believed that a living faith always brought with it the
      presence of Christ, for there can be no true faith without actual spiritual
      contact with the Saviour. Therefore Zwingli held that there was a Real
      Presence of Christ in the Holy Supper; but a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg
      56]</a></span> spiritual presence brought by the faith of the believing
      communicant and not by the elements of Bread and Wine, which were only
      the signs <i>representing</i> a Body which was corporeally absent.
      The defect of this theory is that it does not make the Presence of
      Christ in the Sacrament in any way depend on the ordinance; there is
      no sacramental presence other than what there is in any act of faith.
      It was not until Zwingli had elaborated his theory that he sought for
      and found an explanation of the words of our Lord, and taught that <i>This
      is My Body</i>, must mean <i>This signifies My Body</i>. His theory
      was entirely different from that of Carlstadt, with which Luther always
      identified it.</p>
<p>Luther approached the whole subject by a different path. What repelled
      him in the medi&aelig;val doctrine of the Holy Supper was the way in
      which he believed it to trample on the spiritual priesthood of all
      believers. He protested against Transubstantiation and private Masses,
      because they were the most flagrant instances of that contempt. When
      he first preached on the subject (1519) it was to demand the &ldquo;cup&rdquo; for
      the laity, and he makes use of an expression in his sermon which reveals
      how his thoughts were tending. He says that in the Sacrament of the
      Holy Supper &ldquo;the communicant is so united to Christ <i>and His saints</i>,
      that Christ&rsquo;s life and sufferings <i>and the lives and sufferings of
      the saints</i> become his.&rdquo; No one held more strongly than Luther that
      the Atonement was made by our Lord, and by Him alone. Therefore he
      cannot be thinking of the Atonement when he speaks of union with the
      lives and the sufferings of the saints. He believes that the main thing
      in the Sacrament is that it gives such a companionship with Jesus as
      His disciples and saints have had. There was, of course, a reference
      to the death of Christ and to the Atonement, for apart from that death
      no companionship is possible; but the reference is indirect, and through
      the thought of the fellowship. In the Sacrament we touch Christ as
      His disciples might have touched Him when He lived on earth, and as
      His glorified saints touch Him now. This reference, therefore, clearly
      shows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> that
      Luther saw in the Sacrament of the Supper the presence of the glorified
      Body of our Lord, and that the primary use of the Sacrament was to
      bring the communicant into contact with that glorified Body. This required
      a presence (and Luther thought a presence extended in space) of the
      glorified Body of Christ in the Sacrament in order that the communicant
      might be in actual contact with it. But communion with the Living Christ
      implies the appropriation of the death of Christ, and of the Atonement
      won by His death. Thus the reference to the Crucified Christ which
      Zwingli reaches directly, Luther attains indirectly; and the reference
      to the Living Risen Christ which Zwingli reaches indirectly, Luther
      attains directly. Luther avoided the need of a priestly miracle to
      bring the Body extended in space into immediate connection with the
      elements Bread and Wine, by introducing a scholastic theory of what
      is meant by presence in Space. A body may be present in Space, said
      the Schoolmen, in two ways: it may be present in such a way that it
      excludes from the space it occupies any other body, or it may be present
      occupying the same space with another body. The Glorified Body of Christ
      can be present in the latter manner. It was so when our Lord after
      His Resurrection appeared suddenly among His disciples in a room when
      the doors were shut; for then at some moment of time it must have occupied
      the same space as a portion of the walls or of the door. Christ&rsquo;s glorified
      Body can therefore be naturally in the <i>elements</i> without any
      special miracle, for it is <i>ubiquitous</i>. It is in the table at
      which I write, said Luther; in the stone which I hurl through the air.
      It is in the <i>elements</i> in the Holy Supper in a perfectly natural
      way, and needs no priestly miracle to bring it there. This natural
      presence of the Body of Christ in the elements in the Supper is changed
      into a Sacramental Presence by the promise of God, which is attached
      to the reverent and believing partaking of the Holy Supper.</p>
<p>These were the two theories which ostensibly divided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg
                  58]</a></span> the Protestants in 1529 into two parties,
                  the one of which was led by Zwingli and the other by Luther.
                  They were not so antagonistic that they could not be reconciled.
                  Each theologian held implicitly what the other declared
                  explicitly. Zwingli placed the relation to the Death of
                  Christ in the foreground, but implicitly admitted the relation
                  to the Risen Christ&mdash;going back to the view held in
                  the Early Church. Luther put fellowship with the Risen
                  Christ in the foreground, but admitted the reference to
                  the Crucified Christ&mdash;accepting the medi&aelig;val
                  way of looking at the matter. The one had recourse to a
                  very shallow exegesis to help him, and the other to a scholastic
                  theory of space; and naturally, but unfortunately, when
                  controversy arose, the disputant attacked the weakest part
                  of his opponent&rsquo;s theory&mdash;Luther, Zwingli&rsquo;s exegesis;
                  and Zwingli, Luther&rsquo;s scholastic theory of spatial presence.</p>
<p>The attempt to bring about an understanding between Luther and Zwingli,
      made by Philip of Hesse, the confidant of Zwingli, and in sympathy
      with the Swiss Reformer&rsquo;s schemes of political combination, has already
      been mentioned, and its failure related.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> It
      need not be discussed again. But for the history of the Reformation
      in Switzerland it is necessary to say something about the further progress
      of this Sacramental controversy. Calvin gradually won over the Swiss
      Protestants to his views; and his theory, which at one time seemed
      about to unite the divided Protestants, must be alluded to.</p>
<p>Calvin began his study of the doctrine of the Sacrament of the Holy Supper
      independently of both Luther and Zwingli. His position as the theologian
      of Switzerland, and his friendship with his colleague William Farel,
      who was a Zwinglian, made him adapt his theory to Zwinglian language;
      but he borrowed nothing from the Reformer of Zurich. He was quite willing
      to accept Zwingli&rsquo;s exegesis so far as the words went; but he gave
      another and altogether different meaning to Zwingli&rsquo;s phrase, <i>This
      signifies My Body</i>. He was willing to call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg
      59]</a></span> the &ldquo;elements&rdquo; <i>signs</i> of the Body and Blood of
      the Lord; but while Zwingli called them signs which <i>represent</i> (<i>signa
      representativa</i>) what was <i>absent</i>, Calvin insisted on calling
      them signs which <i>exhibit</i> (<i>signa exhibitiva</i>) what was <i>present</i>&mdash;a
      distinction which is continually forgotten in describing his relation
      to the theories of Zwingli, and one which enabled him to convince Luther
      that he held that there was a Real Presence of Christ&rsquo;s Body in the
      Sacrament of the Holy Supper. To describe minutely Calvin&rsquo;s doctrine
      of the Holy Supper would require more space than can be given here,
      and a brief statement of the central thoughts is alone possible. His
      aim in common with all the Reformers was to construct a doctrine of
      the Sacrament of the Supper which would be at once scriptural, free
      from superstition and from the crass materialist associations which
      had gathered round the theory of transubstantiation, and which would
      clearly conserve the great Reformation proclamation of the spiritual
      priesthood of all believers. He went back to the medi&aelig;val idea
      of transubstantiation, and asked whether it gave a true conception
      of what was meant by <i>substance</i>. He decided that it did not,
      and believed that the root thought in <i>substance</i> was not dimensions
      in space, but power. The <i>substance</i> of a body consists in its <i>power</i>,
      active and passive, and the <i>presence</i> of the <i>substance</i> of
      anything consists in the immediate application of that power.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> When
      Luther and Zwingli had spoken of the <i>substance</i> of the Body of
      Christ, they had always in their mind the thought of something extended
      in space; and the one affirmed while the other denied that this Body
      of Christ, something extended in space, could be and was present in
      the Sacrament of the Supper. Calvin&rsquo;s conception of <i>substance</i> enabled
      him to say that wherever anything acts there it is. He denied the crude &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; presence
      which Luther insisted on; and in this he sided with Zwingli. But he
      affirmed a real because active presence, and in this he sided with
      Luther.</p>
<p>Calvin&rsquo;s view had been accepted definitely by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg
                  60]</a></span> Melanchthon, and somewhat indefinitely by
                  Luther. The imperial cities, led by Strassburg, which was
                  under the influence of Bucer, who had thought out for himself
                  a doctrine not unlike that of Calvin, had been included
                  in the Wittenberg Concord (May 1536); but Luther would
                  have nothing to do with the Swiss. As it was vain to hope
                  that Switzerland would be included in any Lutheran alliance,
                  Calvin set himself to produce dogmatic harmony in Switzerland.
                  In conjunction with Bullinger, Zwingli&rsquo;s son-in-law and
                  successor in Zurich, he drafted the <i>Consensus of Zurich</i> (<i>Consensus
                  Tigurinus</i>) in 1549.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The
                  document is Calvinist in theology and largely Zwinglian
                  in language. It was accepted with some difficulty in Basel
                  and in Bern, and heartily in Biel, Schaffhausen, M&uuml;hlhausen,
                  and St. Gallen. It ended dogmatic disputes in Protestant
                  Switzerland, which was thus united under the one creed.</p>
<p>This does not mean any increase of Protestantism within Switzerland. The
      Romanist cantons drew more closely together. Cardinal Carlo Borromeo
      of Milan took a deep interest in the Counter-Reformation in Switzerland.
      He introduced the Jesuits into Luzern and the Forest cantons, and after
      his death these cantons formed a league which included Luzern, Uri,
      Schwyz, Zug, Unterwalden, Freiburg, and Solothurn (1586). This League
      (<i>the Borromean League</i>) pledged its members to maintain the Roman
      Catholic faith. The lines of demarcation between Protestant and Romanist
      cantons in Switzerland practically survive to the present day.</p>

<h3>THE REFORMATION IN GENEVA UNDER CALVIN.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></h3>
<h3>&sect; 1. <i>Geneva.</i></h3>
<p>Geneva, which was to be the citadel of the Reformed faith in Europe, had
      a history which prepared it for the part it was destined to play.</p>
<p>The ancient constitution of the town, solemnly promulgated in 1387, recognised
      three different authorities within its walls: the Bishop, who was the
      sovereign or
      &ldquo;Prince&rdquo; of the city; the Count, who had possession of the citadel;
      and the Free Burghers. The first act of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg
      62]</a></span> Bishop on his nomination was to go to the Church of
      St. Peter and swear on the Missal that he would maintain the civic
      rights. The House of Savoy had succeeded to the countship of Geneva,
      and they were represented within the town by a viceroy, who was called
      the Count or <i>Vidomne</i>. He was the supreme justiciary. The citizens
      were democratically organised. They met once a year in a recognised
      civic assembly to elect four Syndics to be their rulers and representatives.
      It was the Syndics who in their official capacity heard the oaths of
      the Bishop and of the Vidomne to uphold the rights and privileges of
      the town. They kept order within the walls from sunrise to sunset.</p>
<p>These three separate authorities were frequently in conflict, and in the
      triangular duel the citizens and the Bishop were generally in alliance
      against the House of Savoy and its viceroy. The consequence was that
      few medi&aelig;val cities under ecclesiastical rule were more loyal
      than Geneva was to its Bishop, so long as he respected the people&rsquo;s
      rights and stood by them against their feudal lords when they attempted
      oppression.</p>
<p>In the years succeeding 1444 the hereditary loyalty to their bishops had
      to stand severe tests. Count Amadeus <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> of
      Savoy, one of the most remarkable men of the fifteenth century,&mdash;he
      ascended the papal throne and resigned the Pontificate to become a
      hermit,&mdash;used his pontifical power to possess himself of the bishopric.
      From that date onwards the Bishop of Geneva was almost always a member
      of the House of Savoy, and the rights of the citizens were for the
      most part disregarded. The bishopric became an appanage of Savoy, and
      boys (one of ten years of age, another of seventeen) and bastards ruled
      from the episcopal chair.</p>
<p>After long endurance a party formed itself among the townspeople vowed
      to restore the old rights of the city. They called themselves, or were
      named by others, the <i>Eidguenots</i> (<i>Eidgenossen</i>); while
      the partisans of the Bishop and of the House of Savoy were termed <i>Mamelukes</i>,
      because, it was said, they had forsaken Christianity.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></p>
<p>In their difficulties the Genevans turned to the Swiss cantons nearest
      them and asked to be allied with Freiburg and Bern. Freiburg consented,
      and an alliance was made in 1519; but Bern, an aristocratic republic,
      was unwilling to meddle in the struggle of a democracy in a town outside
      the Swiss Confederacy. The citizens of Bern, more sympathetic than
      their rulers, compelled them to make alliance with Geneva in 1526,&mdash;very
      half-heartedly on the part of the Bernese Council.</p>
<p>The Swiss cantons, Bern especially, could not in their own interest see
      the patriotic party in Geneva wholly crushed, and the &ldquo;gate of Western
      Switzerland&rdquo; left completely in possession of the House of Savoy. Therefore,
      when the Bishop assembled an army for the purpose of effectually crushing
      all opposition within the town, Bern and Freiburg collected their forces
      and routed the troops of Savoy. But the allies, instead of using to
      the full the advantage they had gained, were content with a compromise
      by which the Bishop remained the lord of Geneva, while the rights of
      the Vidomne were greatly curtailed, and the privileges of the townsmen
      were to be respected (Oct. 19th, 1530).</p>
<p>From this date onwards Geneva was governed by what was called <i>le Petit
            Conseil</i>, and was generally spoken of as the Council; then
            a <i>Council of Two Hundred</i>, framed on the model of those
            of Freiburg and Bern; lastly, by the <i>Conseil General</i>,
            or assembly of the citizens. All important transactions were
            first submitted to and deliberated on by the <i>Petit Conseil</i>,
            which handed them on with their opinion of what ought to be done
            to the <i>Council of the Two Hundred</i>. No change of situation&mdash;for
            example, the adoption of the Reformation&mdash;was finally adopted
            until submitted to the <i>General Council</i> of all the burghers.</p>
<p>It is possible that had there seemed to be any immediate prospects that
      Geneva would join the Reformation, Bern would have aided the patriots
      more effectually. Bern was the great Protestant Power in Western Switzerland.
      Its uniform policy, since 1528, had been to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg
      64]</a></span> constitute itself the protector of towns and districts
      where a majority of the inhabitants were anxious to take the side of
      the Reformation and were hindered by their overlords. It made alliances
      with the towns in the territories of the Bishop of Basel, and enabled
      them to assert their independence. In May (23rd) 1532 it warned the
      Duke of Savoy that if he thought of persecuting the inhabitants of
      Payerne because of their religion, it would make their cause its own,
      and declared that its alliance with the town was much more ancient
      than any existing between Bern and the Duke.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> But
      the case of Geneva was different. Signs, indeed, were not lacking that
      many of the people were inclined to the Reformation.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> It
      is more than probable that some of the members of the Councils were
      longing for a religious reform. But however much in earnest the reformers
      might be, they were in a minority, and it was no part of the policy
      of Bern to interfere without due call in the internal administration
      of the city; still less to see the rise of a strong and independent
      Roman Catholic city-republic on its own western border.</p>
<p>Suddenly, in the middle of 1532, Geneva was thrown into a state of violent
      religious commotion. Pope Clement <span class="smcap">VII.</span> had
      published an Indulgence within the city on the usual conditions. On
      the morning of June 9th, the citizens found posted up on all the doors
      of the churches great printed placards, announcing that &ldquo;plenary pardon
      would be granted to every one for all their sins on the one condition
      of repentance, and a living faith in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg
      65]</a></span> promises of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; The city was moved to its
      depths. Priests rushed to tear the placards down.
      &ldquo;Lutherans&rdquo; interfered. Tumults ensued; and one of the canons of the
      cathedral, Pierre Werly, was wounded in the arm.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>
<p>The Romanists, both inside and outside the town, were inclined to believe
      that the affair meant more than it really did. Freiburg had been very
      suspicious of the influence of the great Protestant canton of Bern,
      perhaps not without reason. In March (7th) 1532, the deputies of Geneva
      had been blamed by the inhabitants of Freiburg for being inclined to
      Lutheranism, and it is more than likely that the Evangelicals of Geneva
      had some private dealings with the Council of Bern, and had been told
      that the times were not ripe for any open action on the part of the
      Protestant canton. The affair of the placards, witnessing as it did
      the increased strength of the Evangelical party, reawakened suspicions
      and intensified alarms. A deputy from Freiburg appeared before the
      Council of Geneva, complaining of the placards,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> and
      of the distribution of heretical literature in the city of Geneva (June
      24th). The Papal Nuncio wrote from Chamb&eacute;ry (July 8th), asking
      if it were true, as was publicly reported, that the Lutheran heresy
      was openly professed and taught in the houses, churches, and even in
      the schools of Geneva.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> The
      letter of the Nuncio was dismissed with a careless answer; but Freiburg
      had to be contented.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg
      66]</a></span> Two extracts from the Register of the Council quoted
      by Herminjard show their anxiety to satisfy Freiburg and yet bear evidence
      of a very moderate zeal for the Romanist religion. They decided (June
      29th) that no schoolmaster was to be allowed to preach in the town
      unless specially licensed by the vicar or the Syndics; and (June 30th)
      they resolved to request the vicar to see that the Gospel and the Epistle
      of the day were read &ldquo;truthfully without being mixed up with fables
      and other inventions of men&rdquo;; they added that they meant to live as
      their fathers, without any innovations.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>
<p>The excitement had not died down when Farel arrived in the city in the
      autumn of 1532. He preached quietly in houses; but his coming was known,
      and led to some tumults. He and his companions, Saunier and Oliv&eacute;tan,
      were seized and sent out of the city. The Reformation had begun, and,
      in spite of many hindrances, was destined to be successful.</p>
<h3>&sect; 2. <i>The Reformation in Western Switzerland.</i></h3>
<p>The conversion of Geneva to the Reformed faith was the crown of a work
      which had been promoted by the canton of Bern ever since its Council
      had decided, in 1528, to adopt the Reformation. Bern itself belonged
      to German-speaking Switzerland, but it had extensive possessions in
      the French-speaking districts. It was the only State strong enough
      to confront the Dukes of Savoy, and was looked upon as a natural protector
      against that House and other feudal principalities. Its position may
      be seen in its relations to the Pays de Vaud. The Pays de Vaud consisted
      of a confederacy of towns and small feudal estates owning fealty to
      the House of Savoy. The nobles, the towns, and in some instances the
      clergy, sent deputies to a Diet which met at Moudon under the presidency
      of the &ldquo;governor and bailli de Vaud,&rdquo; who represented the Duke of Savoy.
      A large portion of the country had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg
      67]</a></span> broken away from Savoy at different periods during the
      fifteenth century. Lausanne and eight other smaller towns and districts
      formed the patrimony of the Prince-Bishop of Lausanne. The cantons
      of Freiburg and Bern ruled jointly over Orbe, Grandson, and Morat.
      Bern had become the sole ruler over what were called the four commanderies
      of Aigle, Ormonts, Ollon, and Bex. These four commanderies were outlying
      portions of Bern, and were entirely under the rule of its Council.
      When Bern had accepted the Reformation, it naturally wished its dependencies
      to follow its example; and its policy was always directed to induce
      other portions of the Pays de Vaud to become Protestant also. Farel,
      the Apostle of French-speaking Switzerland, might almost be called
      an agent of the Council of Bern.</p>
<p>Its method of work may be best seen by taking the examples of Aigle and
      Lausanne, the one its own possession and the other belonging to the
      Prince-Bishop, who was its political ruler.</p>
<p>William Farel, once a member of the &ldquo;group of Meaux,&rdquo; whom we have already
      seen active at the Disputation in Bern in the beginning of 1528, had
      settled at Aigle in 1526, probably by the middle of November.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> He
      did so, he says in his memoir to the Council of Bern&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;With the intention of opening a school to instruct the youth in
            virtue and learning, and in order to procure for myself the necessities
            of life. Received at once with brotherly good-will by some of
            the burghers of the place, I was asked by them to preach the
            Word of God before the Governor, who was then at Bern, had returned.
            I acceded to their request. But as soon as the Governor returned
            I asked his permission to keep the school, and by acquaintances
            also asked him to permit me to preach. The Governor acceded to
            their request, but on condition that I preached nothing but the
            pure simple clear Word of God according to the Old and New Testament,
            without any addition contrary to the Word, and without attacking
            the Holy Sacraments.... I promised to conform myself to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg
            68]</a></span> will of the Governor, and declared myself ready
            to submit to any punishment he pleased to inflict upon me if
            I disobeyed his orders or acted in any way recognised to be contrary
            to the Word of God.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was the beginning of a work which gradually spread over French-speaking
      Switzerland.</p>
<p>The Bishop of Sion, within whose diocese Aigle was situated, published
      an order forbidding all wandering preachers who had not his episcopal
      licence from preaching within the confines of his diocese; and this
      appears to have been used against Farel. Some representation must have
      been made to the Council of Bern, who indignantly declared that no
      one was permitted to publish citations, excommunications, interdicts, <i>ne
      autres fanfares</i> within their territories; but at the same time
      ordered Farel to cease preaching, because he had never been ordained
      a priest (February 22nd, 1527).<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> The
      interdict did not last very long; for a minute of Council (March 8th)
      says, &ldquo;Farel is permitted to preach at Aigle until the Coadjutor sends
      another capable priest.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Troubles
      arose from priests and monks, but upon the whole the Council of Bern
      supported him; and Haller and others wrote from Bern privately, beseeching
      him to persevere.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> He
      remained, and the number of those who accepted the Evangelical faith
      under his ministry increased gradually until they appear to have been
      the majority of the people.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> He
      confessed himself that what hindered him most was his denunciation
      of the prevailing immoralities. At the Disputation in Bern, Farel was
      recognised to be one of the ablest theologians present, and to have
      contributed in no small degree to the success of the conference. The
      Council<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> of
      Bern saw in him the instrument best fitted for the evangelisation of
      their French-speaking population. He returned to Aigle under the protection
      of the Council, who sent a herald with him to ensure that he should
      be treated with all respect, and gave him besides an &ldquo;open letter,&rdquo; ordering
      their officials to render him all assistance everywhere within their
      four commanderies.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> He
      was recognised to be the evangelist of the Council of Bern. This did
      not prevent occasional disturbances, riots promoted by priests and
      monks, who set the bells a-ringing to drown the preacher&rsquo;s voice, and
      sometimes procured men to beat drums at the doors of the churches in
      which he was preaching. His success, however, was so great, that when
      the commissioners of Bern visited their four commanderies they found
      that three of them were ready by a majority of votes to adopt the Reformation
      (March 2nd, 1528). The adoption of the Reformation was signified by
      the removal of altars and images, and by the abolition of the Mass.</p>
<p>In the parishes where a majority of the people declared for the Reformation,
      the Council of Bern issued instructions about the order of public worship
      and other ecclesiastical rites. Thus we find them intimating to their
      Governor at Aigle that they expected the people to observe the same
      form of Baptism, of the Table of the Lord, and of the celebration of
      marriage, as was in use at Bern (April 25th, 1528).<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> The
      Bern Liturgy, obligatory in all the German-speaking districts of the
      canton, was not imposed on the Romance Churches until 1552. Then, in
      July (1528), the Governor is informed that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;My Lords have resolved to allow to the preachers Farel and Simon
            &lsquo;pour leur pr&eacute;bende&rsquo; two hundred florins of Savoy annually,
            and a house with a court, and a kitchen garden. But if they prefer
            to have the old revenues of the parish cures ... my Lords are
            willing. If, on the contrary, they take the two hundred florins,
            you are to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg
            70]</a></span>sell the ecclesiastical goods, and you are to collect
            the hundredths and the tithes, and out of all you are to pay
            the two hundred florins annually.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The pastors preferred to take the place of the Romanist incumbents, and
      there is accordingly another minute sent to the Castellan, syndic,
      and parishioners of Aigle, ordering Farel to be placed in possession
      of the ecclesiastical possessions of the parish, &ldquo;seeing that it is
      reasonable that the pastor should have his portion of the fruits of
      the sheep.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>
<p>The history of Aigle was repeated over and over again in other parts of
      western Switzerland. In the bailiwicks which Bern and Freiburg ruled
      jointly, Bern insisted on freedom of preaching, and on the right of
      the people to choose whether they would remain Romanists or become
      Protestants. Commissioners from the two cantons presided when the votes
      were given.</p>
<p>Farel was too valuable to be left as pastor of a small district like Aigle.
      We find him making wide preaching tours, always protected by Bern when
      protection was possible. It was the rooted belief of the Protestants
      that a public Disputation on matters of religion in presence of the
      people, the speakers using the language understood by the crowd, always
      resulted in spreading the Reformation; and Bern continually tried to
      get such conferences in towns where the authorities were Romanist.
      Their first interference in the ecclesiastical affairs of Lausanne
      was of this kind. It seems that some of the priests of Lausanne had
      accused Farel of being a heretic; whereupon the Council of Bern demanded
      that Farel should be heard before the Bishop of Lausanne&rsquo;s tribunal,
      in order to prove that he was no heretic. The claim led to a long correspondence.
      The Bishop continually refused; while the Council and citizens seemed
      inclined to grant the request. Farel could not get a hearing before
      the episcopal tribunal, but he visited the town, and on the second
      occasion was permitted by the Council to preach to the people. This
      occurred again and again; and the result was that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg
      71]</a></span> town became Protestant and disowned the authority of
      the Bishop. Bern assisted the inhabitants to drive the Bishop away,
      and to become a free municipality and Protestant.</p>
<p>Gradually Farel had become the leader of an organised band of missioners,
      who devoted themselves to the evangelisation of western or French-speaking
      Switzerland.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> They
      had been carefully selected&mdash;young men for the most part well
      educated, of unbounded courage, willing to face all the risks of their
      dangerous work, daunted by no threat or peril, taking their lives in
      their hand. They were the forerunners of the young preachers, teachers,
      and colporteurs whom Calvin trained later in Geneva and sent forth
      by the hundred to evangelise France and the Low Countries. They were
      all picked men. No one was admitted to the little band without being
      well warned of the hazardous work before him, and some who were ready
      to take all the risks were rejected because the leader was not sure
      that they had the necessary powers of endurance.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> These
      preachers were under the protection of the canton of Bern, whose authorities
      were resolute to maintain the freedom to preach the Word of God; but
      they continually went where the Bernese had no power to assist them;
      nor could the protection of that powerful canton aid them in sudden
      emergencies when bitter Romanist partisans, infuriated by the invectives
      with which the preachers lashed the abuses of the Roman religion, or
      wrathful at their very presence, stirred up the mob against them. When
      their correspondence and that of their opponents&mdash;a correspondence
      collected and carefully edited by M. Herminjard&mdash;is read, it can
      be seen that they could always count on a certain amount of sympathy
      from the people of the towns and villages where they preached, but
      that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> authorities
      were for the most part hostile. If Bern insisted on their protection,
      Freiburg was as active in opposing them, and lost no opportunity of
      urging the local authorities to harass them in every way, to silence
      their preaching, and if possible to expel them from their territories.</p>
<p>Such men had the defects of their qualities. Their zeal often outran their
      discretion. When Farel and Froment, the most daring and devoted of
      his band, were preaching at a village in the vale of Villingen, a priest
      began to chant the Mass beside them. As the priest elevated the Host,
      Froment seized it and, turning towards the people, said, &ldquo;This is not
      the God to adore; He is in the Heaven in the glory of the Father, not
      in the hands of the priests as you believe, and as they teach.&rdquo; There
      was a riot, of course, but the preachers escaped. Next day, however,
      as they were passing a solitary place, they were assailed by a crowd
      of men and women, stoned and beaten with clubs, then hurried away to
      a neighbouring castle whose chatelaine had instigated the attack. There
      they were thrust violently into the chapel, and the crowd tried to
      make Farel prostrate himself before an image of the Blessed Virgin.
      He resisted, admonishing them to adore the one God in spirit and in
      truth, not dumb images without sense or power. The crowd beat him to
      the effusion of blood, and the two preachers were dragged to a vault,
      where they were imprisoned until rescued by the authorities of Neuch&acirc;tel.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>
<p>These preachers were all Frenchmen or French-Swiss. They had the hot Celtic
      blood in their veins, and their hearers were their kith and kin&mdash;prompt
      to act, impetuous when their passions were stirred. Scenes occurred
      at their preaching which we seldom hear of among slower Germans, who
      generally waited until their authorities led. In western Switzerland
      the audiences were eager to get rid of the idolatries denounced. At
      Grandson, the people rushed to the church of the Cordeliers, and tore
      down the altars and images, while the crosses, altars, and images<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg
      73]</a></span> of the parish church were also destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Similar
      tumults took place at Orbe; and the authorities at Bern, who desired
      to see liberty for both Protestants and Romanists, had occasion to
      rebuke the zealous preachers.</p>
<p>But the dangers which the missioners ran were not always of their own
      provoking. Sometimes a crowd of women invaded the churches in which
      they preached, interrupted the services with shoutings, hustled and
      beat the preachers; sometimes when they addressed the people in the
      market-place the preachers and their audience were assailed with showers
      of stones; sometimes Farel and his companions were laid wait for and
      maltreated.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> M.
      de Watteville, sent down by the authorities of Bern to report on disturbances,
      wrote to the Council of Bern that the faces of the preachers were so
      torn that it looked as if they had been fighting with cats, and that
      on one occasion the alarm-bell had been sounded against them, as was
      the custom for a wolf-hunt.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>
<p>No dangers daunted the missioners, and soon the whole of the outlying
      districts of Bern, Neuch&acirc;tel, Soleure, and other French-speaking
      portions of Switzerland declared for the Reformation. The cantonal
      authorities frequently sent down commissioners to ascertain the wishes
      of the people; and when the majority of the inhabitants voted for the
      Evangelical religion, the church, parsonage, and stipend were given
      to a Protestant pastor. Many of Farel&rsquo;s missioners were temporarily
      settled in these village churches; but they were for the most part
      better fitted for pioneer work than for a settled pastorate. In January
      (9-14th) 1532, a synod of these Protestant pastors was held at Bern
      to deliberate on some uniform ways of exercising their ministry to
      prevent disorders arising from individual caprice. Two hundred and
      thirty ministers were present, and Bucer was brought from Strassburg
      to give them guidance. His advice was greatly appreciated and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg
      74]</a></span> followed by the delegates of the churches and the Council
      of Bern. The Synod in the end issued an elaborate ordinance, which
      included a lengthy exposition of doctrine.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>
<h3>&sect; 3. <i>Farel in Geneva.</i></h3>
<p>It was after this consolidation of the Reformation in Bern and its outlying
      provinces that Farel found himself free to turn his attention to Geneva.
      He had evidently been thinking for months about the possibility of
      evangelising the town. He had little fear of the people themselves,
      and he wrote to Zwingli (Oct. 1st, 1531) that were it not for the dread
      of Freiburg, he believed that the Genevese would welcome the Gospel.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> The
      affair of the
      &ldquo;placards&rdquo; seems to have decided him to begin his mission in the city.
      When he was driven out he was far from abandoning the enterprise. He
      turned to Froment, his most trusted assistant, and sent him into Geneva.</p>
<p>Antoine Froment, who has the honour along with Farel of being the Reformer
      of Geneva, was born at Tries, near Grenoble, about 1510. He was therefore,
      like Farel, a native of Dauphin&eacute;. Like him, also, he had gone
      to Paris for his education, and had become acquainted with Lef&egrave;vre,
      who seems to have introduced him to Marguerite d&rsquo;Angoul&ecirc;me, the
      Queen of Navarre,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> as
      he received from her a prebend in a canonry on one of her estates.
      How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> he
      came to Switzerland is unknown. Once there and introduced to Farel,
      he became his most daring and enthusiastic disciple, and Farel prized
      him above all the others. They were Paul and Timothy. It was natural
      that Farel should entrust him with the difficult and dangerous task
      of preaching the Gospel in Geneva.</p>
<p>Farel&rsquo;s seizure and expulsion made it necessary to proceed with caution.
      Froment entered Geneva (Nov. 3rd, 1532), and began his work by intimating
      by public advertisement (<i>placard</i>) that he was ready to teach
      any one who wished to learn to read and write the French language,
      and that he would charge no fees if his pupils were not able to profit
      by his instructions. Scholars came.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> He
      managed to mingle Evangelical instruction with his lessons,&mdash;&ldquo;every
      day one or two sermons from the Holy Scripture,&rdquo; he says,&mdash;and
      soon made many converts, especially among the wives of influential
      citizens. Towards the end of 1532, the monks of one of the convents
      in Geneva had brought to the city a Dominican, Christopher Bocquet,
      to be their Advent preacher. His sermons seem to have been largely
      Evangelical, and had the effect of inducing many of the citizens to
      attend Froment&rsquo;s discourses in the hall where he kept his school.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> This
      provoked threats on the part of the Romanists, and strongly worded
      sermons from the priests and Romanist orators. One citizen, convicted
      of having spoken disrespectfully of the Mass, was banished, and forbidden
      to return on pain of death. On this the Evangelicals of the town appealed
      to Bern. Their letter was promptly answered by a demand on the part
      of the Council of that canton that the Evangelicals must be left in
      peace, and if attacked publicly must be allowed to answer in as public
      a fashion.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> When
      their letter was read in the Council of Geneva, it provoked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg
      76]</a></span> some protests from the more ardently Romanist members,
      and the priests stirred up part of the population to riotous proceedings,
      in which the lives of the Evangelicals were threatened. The Syndics
      and Council had difficulty in preventing conflicts in the streets.
      They published a decree (March 30th, 1533), in which they practically
      proclaimed liberty of conscience, but forbade all insulting expressions,
      all attacks on the Sacraments or on the ecclesiastical fasts and ceremonies,
      and again ordered preachers to say nothing which could not be proved
      from Holy Scripture.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>
<p>The numbers of the Evangelicals increased daily; they became bolder, and
      on the 10th of April they met in a garden, under the presidency of
      Gu&eacute;rin Mu&egrave;te, a hosier, for the celebration of the Lord&rsquo;s
      Supper. This became known to the Romanists, and there was a renewal
      of the threats against the Evangelicals, which came to a head in the
      riot of the 5th of May&mdash;a riot which had important consequences.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> It
      seems that while several citizens, known to belong to the Evangelical
      party, were walking in the square before the Cathedral of St. Peter,
      they were attacked by a band of armed priests, and three of them were
      severely wounded. The leader of the band, a turbulent priest named
      Pierre Werly, who belonged to an old family of Freiburg, and was a
      canon in the cathedral, followed by five or six others, rushed down
      to the broad street Molard, with loud shouts. Werly was armed with
      one of the huge Swiss swords. He and his companions attacked the Evangelicals;
      there was a sharp, short fight; several persons were wounded severely,
      and Werly, &ldquo;the captain of the priests,&rdquo; was slain.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> The
      affair made a great noise. The Romanists at once proclaimed Werly a
      martyr, and honoured him with a pompous funeral. Freiburg insisted
      that all the Evangelicals who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg
      77]</a></span> happened to be in the Molard should be arrested; and
      it was said that preparations were being made for a massacre of all
      the followers of the Reformation. In their extremity they again appealed
      to Bern, whose authorities again interfered for their protection.</p>
<p>During these troublesome times the position of the Council of Geneva was
      one of great difficulty. The Prince-Bishop of Geneva, Pierre de la
      Baume, was still nominally sovereign, secular as well as ecclesiastical
      ruler. His secular powers had been greatly curtailed, how much it is
      difficult to say, but certainly to the extent that the criminal administration
      of the city and the territory subject to it was in the hands of the
      Council and Syndics. Freiburg, one of the two protecting cantons, insisted
      that all the ecclesiastical authority was still in the hands of the
      Bishop, to be administered in his absence by his vicar.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> The
      Councils, although they had passed decrees (June 30th, 1532, and March
      30th, 1533) which had distinctly to do with ecclesiastical matters,
      acknowledged for the most part that the ecclesiastical jurisdiction
      did not belong to them. But the whole of the inhabitants were not contented
      with this diminution of the episcopal authority. Turbulent priests
      and the yet more violent canons,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> the
      great body of monks and nuns, wished, and intrigued for the restoration
      of the rule of the Bishop and of the House of Savoy. The beginnings
      of a movement for Reformation had increased the difficulties of the
      Council; it brought a third party into the town. The Evangelicals were
      all strongly opposed to the rule of the Bishop and Savoy, and they
      were fast growing in strength; a powerful minority of Roman Catholics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg
      78]</a></span> were no less strongly in favour of a return to the old
      condition. The majority of the Roman Catholic citizens, opposed to
      the Bishop as a secular ruler, had no desire for the triumph of the
      Reformation. As time went on, it was seen that these moderate Romanists
      had to choose between a return of the old disorderly rule of the Bishop,
      or to acquiesce in the ecclesiastical as well as the secular superiority
      of the Council, pressed by the Protestant canton of Bern. The Savoyard
      party evidently believed that their hatred of the Reformation would
      be stronger than their dislike to the Savoyard and episcopal rule&mdash;a
      mistaken belief, as events were to show.</p>
<p>The policy of Bern, wherever its influence prevailed in western Switzerland,
      was exerted to secure toleration for all Evangelicals, and to procure,
      if possible, a public discussion on matters of religion between the
      Romanists and leading Reformers. They pressed this over and over again
      on their allies of Geneva. As early as April 1533, they had insisted
      that a monk who had offered to refute Farel should be kept to his word,
      and that the Council of Geneva should arrange for a Public Disputation.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Towards
      the close of the year an event occurred which gave them a pretext for
      decisive interference.</p>
<p>Guy Furbiti, a renowned Roman Catholic preacher, a learned theologian,
      a doctor of the Sorbonne, had been brought to Geneva to be Advent preacher.
      He used the occasion to denounce vigorously the doctrines of the Evangelicals,
      supporting his statements, as he afterwards confessed, not from Scripture,
      but from the Decretals and from the writings of Thomas Aquinas. He
      ended his sermon (Dec. 2nd) with the words: &ldquo;Where are those fine preachers
      of the fireside, who say the opposite? If they showed themselves here
      one could speak to them. Ha! ha! they are well to hide themselves in
      corners to deceive poor women and others who know nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the sermon, either in church or in the square before the cathedral,
      Froment cried to the crowd, &ldquo;Hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg
      79]</a></span> me! I am ready to give my life, and my body to be burned,
      to maintain that what that man has said is nothing but falsehood and
      the words of Antichrist.&rdquo; There was a great commotion. Some shouted, &ldquo;To
      the fire with him! to the fire!&rdquo; and tried to seize him. The chronicler
      nun, Jeanne de Jussie, proud of her sex, relates that &ldquo;les femmes comme
      enrag&eacute;es sortirent apr&egrave;s, de grande furie, luy jettant
      force pierres.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> He
      escaped from them. But Alexandre Canus was banished, and forbidden
      to return under pain of death; and Froment was hunted from house to
      house, until he found a hiding-place in a hay-loft. Furbiti had permitted
      himself to attack with strong invectives the authorities of Bern, and
      the Evangelicals of Geneva in their appeal for protection sent extracts
      from the sermons.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Bern
      had at last the opportunity for which its Council had long waited.</p>
<p>They wrote a dignified letter (Dec. 17th, 1533) to the Council of Geneva,
      in which they complained that the Genevese, their allies, had hitherto
      paid little attention to their requests for a favourable treatment
      of the Evangelicals; that they had expelled from the town &ldquo;nostre serviteur
      maistre Guillaume Farel&rdquo;; not content with that, they had recently
      misused their &ldquo;servants&rdquo; Froment and Alexandre for protesting against
      the sermons of a Jacobin monk (Furbiti) who &ldquo;preached only lies, errors,
      and blasphemies against God, the faith, and ourselves, wounding our
      honour, calling us Jews, Turks, and dogs&rdquo;; that the banishment of Alexandre
      and the hunting of Froment touched them (the Council of Bern), and
      that they would not suffer it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg
      80]</a></span> They demanded the immediate arrest of the &ldquo;<i>caffard</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> (Furbiti);
      and they said they were about to send an embassy to Geneva to vindicate
      publicly the honour of God and their own.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>
<p>As the Council of Bern meant to enforce a Public Disputation, they sent
      Farel to Geneva. He reached the city on the evening of December 20th.</p>
<p>The letter was read to the Council of Geneva upon Dec. 21st, and they
      at once gave orders to the vicar to prevent Furbiti leaving the town.
      But the vicar, who had resolved to try his strength against Bern, refused,
      and actually published two mandates (Dec. 31st, 1533, and Jan. 1st,
      1534) denouncing the Genevese Syndics, forbidding any of the citizens
      to read the Holy Scriptures, and ordering all copies of translations
      of the Bible, whether in German or in French, to be seized and burnt.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> The
      dispute between Syndics and vicar was signalised by riots promoted
      by the extreme Romanist party. The Council, anxious not to proceed
      to extremities, contented themselves with placing a guard to watch
      Furbiti; and the monk was attended continually, even when he went to
      and from the church, by a guard of three halberdiers.</p>
<p>The Bernese embassy arrived on the 4th of January, and had prolonged audience
      of the Council of Geneva on the 5th and 7th. They insisted on a fair
      treatment for the Evangelical party, which meant freedom of conscience
      and the right of public worship, and they demanded that Furbiti should
      be compelled to justify his charges against the Evangelicals in the
      presence of learned men who could speak for the Council of Bern. The
      Genevan authorities had no wish to break irrevocably with their Bishop,
      nor to coerce the ecclesiastical authorities; they pleaded that Furbiti
      was not under their jurisdiction, and they referred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg
      81]</a></span> the Bernese deputies to the Bishop or his vicar. &ldquo;We
      have been ordered to apply to you,&rdquo; said the deputies from Bern. &ldquo;Your
      answer makes us see that you seek delay, and that you are not treating
      us fairly; that you think little of the honour of the Council of Bern.
      Here is the treaty of alliance (they produced the document), and we
      are about to tear off the seals.&rdquo; This was the formal way among the
      Swiss of cancelling a treaty. The Councillors of Geneva then proposed
      that they should compel the monk to appear before them and the deputies
      of Bern, when explanations might be demanded from him. The deputies
      accepted the offer, but on condition that there should be a conference
      between the monk (Furbiti) and theologians sent from Bern (Farel and
      Viret). Next day Furbiti was taken from the episcopal palace and placed
      in the town&rsquo;s prison (Jan. 8th), and on the morrow (Jan. 9th) he was
      brought before the Council. There he refused to plead before secular
      judges. The Council of Geneva tried in vain to induce the vicar to
      nominate an ecclesiastical delegate who was to sit in the Council and
      be present at the conference. Their negotiations with the vicar, carried
      on for some days, were in vain. Then they attempted to induce the Bernese
      to depart from their conditions. The Council of Bern was immovable.
      It insisted on the immediate payment by the Genevese of the debt due
      to Bern for the war of deliverance and for the punishment of Furbiti
      (Jan. 25th, 1534). Driven to the wall, the Council of Geneva resolved
      to override the ecclesiastical authority of the Bishop and his vicar.
      Furbiti was compelled to appear before the Council and the deputies
      of Bern, and to answer to Farel and Viret on Jan. 27th and Feb. 3rd
      (1534). On the afternoon of the latter day the partisans of the Bishop
      got up another riot, in which one of them poniarded an Evangelical,
      Nicolas Bergier. This riot seems to have exhausted the patience of
      the peaceable citizens of Geneva, whether Romanists or Evangelicals.
      A band of about five hundred assembled armed before the Town Hall,
      informed the Council that they would no longer tolerate riots caused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg
      82]</a></span> by turbulent priests, and that they were ready to support
      civic authority and put down lawlessness with a strong hand. The Council
      thereupon acted energetically. That night the murderer, Claude Pennet,
      who had hid himself in the belfry of the cathedral, was dragged from
      his place of concealment, tried next day, and hanged on the day following
      (Feb. 5th). The houses of the principal rioters were searched, and
      letters discovered proving a plot to seize the town and deliver it
      into the hands of the Bishop. Pierre de la Baume had gone the length
      of nominating a member of the Council of Freiburg, M. Pavillard, to
      act as his deputy in secular affairs, and ordering him to massacre
      the Evangelicals within the city.</p>
<p>When the excitement had somewhat died down, the deputies of Bern pressed
      for a renewal of the proceedings against Furbiti. The monk was again
      brought before the Council, and confronted by Farel and Viret. He was
      forced to confess that he could not prove his assertions from the Holy
      Scriptures, but had based them on the Decretals and the writings of
      Thomas Aquinas, admitting that he had transgressed the regulations
      of the Council of Geneva. He promised that, if allowed to preach on
      the following Sunday (Feb. 15th), he would make public reparation to
      the Council of Bern. When Sunday came he refused to keep his promise,
      and was sent back to prison.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile the Evangelical community in Geneva was growing, and taking
      organised form. One of the most prominent of the Genevan Evangelicals,
      Jean Baudichon de la Maisonneuve, prepared a hall by removing a partition
      between two rooms in his magnificent house, situated in that part of
      the city which was the cradle of the Reformation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg
      83]</a></span> in Geneva. There Farel, Viret, and Froment preached
      to three or four hundred persons; and there the first baptism according
      to the Reformed rite was celebrated in Geneva (Feb. 22nd, 1533). The
      audiences soon increased beyond the capacity of the hall, and the Evangelicals,
      protected by the presence of the Bernese deputies, took possession
      of the large audience hall or church of the Convent of the Cordeliers
      in the same street (March 1st). The deputies from Bern frequently asked
      the Council of Geneva to grant the use of one of the churches of the
      town for the Evangelicals, but were continually answered that the Council
      had not the power, but that they would not object if the Evangelicals
      found a suitable place. This indirect authorisation enabled them to
      meet in the convent church, which held between four and five thousand
      people, and which was frequently filled. Thus the little band increased.
      Farel preached for the first time in St. Peter&rsquo;s on the 8th of August
      1535. Services were held in other houses also.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>
<p>The Bishop of Geneva, foiled in his attempt to regain possession of the
      town by well-planned riots, united himself with the Duke of Savoy to
      conquer the city by force of arms. Their combined forces advanced against
      Geneva; they overran the country, seized and pillaged the country houses
      of the citizens, and subjected the town itself to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg
      84]</a></span> close investment. The war was a grievous matter for
      the city, but it furthered the Reformation. The Bishop had leagued
      himself with the old enemy of Geneva; the priests, the monks, the nuns
      were eager for his success; he compelled patriotic Roman Catholics
      to choose between their religion and their country. It was also a means
      of displaying the heroism of the Protestant pastors. Farel and Froment
      were high-spirited Frenchmen, who scoffed at any danger lying in the
      path of duty. They had braved a thousand perils in their missionary
      work. Viret was not less courageous. The three worked on the fortifications
      with the citizens; they shared the watches of the defenders; they encouraged
      the citizens by word and deed. The Genevese were prepared for any sacrifices
      to preserve their liberties. Four faubourgs, which formed a second
      town almost as large as the first, were ordered to be demolished to
      strengthen the defence. The city was reduced to great straits, and
      the citizens of Bern seemed to be deaf to their cries for help.</p>
<p>Bern was doing its best by embassies to assist them; but it dared not
      attack the Pays de Vaud when Freiburg, angry at the process of the
      Reformation, threatened a counter attack. After the siege was raised,
      the strongholds in the surrounding country remained in the possession
      of the enemy, and the people belonging to Geneva were liable to be
      pillaged and maltreated.</p>
<p>Within the city the number of Evangelicals increased week by week. Then
      came a sensational event which brought about the ruin of the Roman
      Catholic party. A woman, Antonia Vax, cook in the house of Claude Bernard,
      with whom the three pastors dwelt, attempted to poison Viret, Farel,
      and Froment.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> The
      confession of the prisoner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg
      85]</a></span> combined with other circumstances, created the impression
      among the members of Council and the people of Geneva that the priests
      of the town had instigated the attempt, and a strong feeling in favour
      of the Protestant pastors swept over the city. The Council at once
      provided lodging for Viret and Farel in the Convent of the Cordeliers.
      When the guardian of that convent asked leave to hold public discussions
      on religious questions in the great church belonging to the convent,
      it was at once granted.</p>
<p>The Council itself made arrangements for the public Disputation. Five <i>Th&egrave;ses &eacute;vang&eacute;liques</i> were
      drafted by the Protestant pastors, and the Council invited discussion
      upon them from all and sundry.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Invitations
      were sent to the canons of the cathedral, and to all the priests and
      monks of Geneva; safe-conducts were promised to all foreign theologians
      who desired to take part;<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> a
      special attempt was made to induce a renowned Paris Roman Catholic
      champion, Pierre Cornu, a theologian trained at the Sorbonne, who happened
      to be at Grenoble, to defend the Romanist position by attacking the <i>Theses</i>.
      The <i>Theses</i> themselves were posted up in Geneva as early as the
      1st of May (1535), and copies were sent to all the priests and convents
      within the territories of the Genevans.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>
<p>The Disputation was fixed to open on the 30th of May. The Council nominated
      eight commissioners, half of whom were Roman Catholics, to maintain
      order, and four secretaries to keep minutes of the proceedings.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Efforts
      were made to induce Roman Catholic theologians of repute for their
      learning to attend and attack the <i>Theses</i>. But the Bishop of
      Geneva had forbidden the Disputation, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg
      86]</a></span> Council were unable to prevail on any stranger to appear.
      When the opening day arrived, and the Council, commissioners, and secretaries
      were solemnly seated in their places in the great hall of the convent,
      no Romanist defender of the faith appeared to impugn the Evangelical <i>Theses</i>.
      Farel and Viret nevertheless expounded and defended. The Disputation
      continued at intervals during four weeks, till the 24th of June, Romanist
      champions accepted the Reformers&rsquo; challenge&mdash;Jean Chapuis, prior
      of the Dominican convent at Plainpalais, near Geneva, and Jean Cachi,
      confessor to the Sisters of St. Clara in the city. But they were no
      match for men like Farel. Chapuis himself apologised for the absence
      of the Genevan priests and monks, by saying that even in his convent
      there was a lack of learned men. The weakness of the Romanist defence
      made a great impression on the people of Geneva. They went about saying
      to each other, &ldquo;If all Christian princes permitted a free discussion
      like our MM. of Geneva, the affair would soon be settled without burnings,
      or slaughter, or murders; but the Pope and his followers, the cardinals
      and the bishops and the priests, know well that if free discussion
      is permitted all is lost for them. So all these powers forbid any discussion
      or conversation save by fire and by sword.&rdquo; They knew that all throughout
      Romance Switzerland the Reformers, whether in a minority or in a majority,
      were eager for a public discussion.</p>
<p>When the Disputation was ended, Farel urged the Council to declare themselves
      on the side of the Reformation; but they hesitated until popular tumults
      forced their hand. On July 23rd, Farel preached in the Church of the
      Madeleine. The Council made mild remonstrances. Then he preached in
      the Church of St. Gervais. Lastly, on the 8th of August, the people
      forced him to preach in the Cathedral, St. Peter&rsquo;s (Aug. 8th). In the
      afternoon the priests were at vespers as usual. As they chanted the
      Psalm&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza"> <span class="i0">&ldquo;Their idols are silver and gold,<br />

            </span> <span class="i1">Neither speak they through their throat,&rdquo;<br />
      </span> </div>
</div>
<p>someone in the throng shouted, &ldquo;You curse, as you chant, all who make
      graven images and trust in them. Why do you let them remain here?&rdquo; It
      was the signal for a tumult. The crowd rushed to throw to the ground
      and break in pieces the statues of the saints; and the children pushing
      among the crowd picked up the fragments, and rushing to the doors,
      said, &ldquo;We have the gods of the priests, would you like some?&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Next
      day the riots were renewed in the parish and convent churches, and
      the images of the saints were defaced or destroyed.</p>
<p>The Council met on the 9th, and summoned Farel before them. The minutes
      state that he made an <i>oratio magna</i>, ending with the declaration
      that he and his fellow-preachers were willing to submit to death if
      it could be shown that they taught anything contrary to the Holy Scriptures.
      Then, falling on his knees, he poured forth one of those wonderful
      prayers which more than anything else exhibited the exalted enthusiasm
      of the great missionary. The religious question was discussed next
      day in the <i>Council of the Two Hundred</i>, when it was resolved
      to abolish the Mass provisionally, to summon the monks before the Council,
      and to ask them to give their reasons for maintaining the Mass and
      the worship of the saints. The two Councils resolved to inform the
      people of Bern about what they had done.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>
<p>It is evident that the two Councils had been hurried by the iconoclastic
      zeal of the people along a path they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg
      88]</a></span> had meant to tread in a much more leisurely fashion.
      The political position was full of uncertainties. Their enemies were
      still in the field against them. Bern seemed to be unable to assist
      them. They were ready to welcome the intervention of France. It was
      the fear of increasing their external troubles rather than any zeal
      for the Roman Catholic faith that had prevented the Council from espousing
      the Reformation immediately after the public Disputation.
      &ldquo;If we abolish the Mass, image worship, and everything popish, for
      one enemy we have now we are sure to have an hundred,&rdquo; was their thought.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>
<p>The official representatives of the Roman Catholic religion did not appear
      to advantage at this crisis of their fate. They were in no haste to
      defend their worship before the Council. When they at last appeared
      (Nov. 29th, 1535), the monks in the forenoon and the secular clergy
      in the afternoon, there was a careless indifference in their answers.
      The Council seem to have referred them to Farel&rsquo;s summary of the matters
      discussed in the public Disputation which began on the 30th of May,
      and to have asked them what they had to say against its conclusions
      and in favour of the Mass and of the adoration of the saints.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> The
      monks one after another (twelve of them appeared before the Council)
      answered monotonously that they were unlearned people, who lived as
      they had been taught by their fathers, and did not inquire further.
      The secular clergy, by their spokesman Roletus de Pane, said that they
      had nothing to do with the Disputation and what had been said there;
      that they had no desire to listen to more addresses from Farel; and
      that they meant to live as their predecessors.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> This
      was the end. The two deputations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg
      89]</a></span> of monks and seculars were informed by the Council that
      they must cease saying Mass until further orders were given. The Reformation
      was legally established in Geneva, and the city stood forth with Bern
      as altogether Protestant.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>
<p>The dark clouds on the political horizon were rising. France seemed about
      to interfere in favour of Geneva, and the fear of France in possession
      of the &ldquo;gate of western Switzerland&rdquo; was stronger than reluctance to
      permit Geneva to become a Protestant city. The Council of Freiburg
      promised to allow the Bernese army to march through their territory.
      Bern renounced its alliance with Savoy on November 29th, 1535. War
      was declared on January 16th. The army of Bern left its territories,
      gathering reinforcements as it went; for towns like Neuville, Neuch&acirc;tel,
      Lausanne, Payerne&mdash;oppressed Protestant communities in Romance
      Switzerland&mdash;felt that the hour of their liberation was at hand,
      and their armed burghers were eager to strike one good stroke at their
      oppressors under the leadership of the proud republic. There was little
      fighting. The greater part of the Pays de Vaud was conquered without
      striking a blow, and the army of the Duke of Savoy and the Bishop of
      Geneva was dispersed without a battle. A few sieges were needed to
      complete the victory. The great republic, after its fashion, had waited
      till the opportune moment, and then struck once and for all. Its decisive
      victory brought deliverance not only to Geneva, but to Lausanne and
      many other Protestant municipalities in Romance Switzerland (Aug. 7th,
      1536). The democracy of Geneva was served heir to the seignorial rights
      of the Bishop, and to the sovereign rights of the Duke of Savoy over
      city and lands. Geneva became an independent republic under the protectorate
      of Bern, and to some extent dependent on that canton.</p>
<p>In the month of December 1535, the Syndics and Council of Geneva had adopted
      the legend on the coat of arms of the town, <i>Post tenebras lux</i>&mdash;a
      device which became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg
      90]</a></span> very famous, and appeared on its coinage. The resolution
      of the Council of the Two Hundred to abolish the Mass and saint worship
      was officially confirmed by the citizens assembled, &ldquo;as was the custom,
      by sound of bell and of trumpet&rdquo; (May 21st, 1536).</p>
<p>Geneva had gained much. It had won political independence, for which it
      had been fighting for thirty years, modified by its relations to Bern,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> but
      greater than it had ever before enjoyed. The Reformed religion had
      been established, although the fact remained that the Romanist partisans
      had still a good deal of hidden strength. But much was still to be
      done to make the town the citadel of the Reformation which it was to
      become. Its past history had demoralised its people. The rule of dissolute
      bishops and the example of a turbulent and immoral clergy had poisoned
      the morals of the city.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> The
      liberty won might easily degenerate into licence, and ominous signs
      were not lacking that this was about to take place. &ldquo;It is impossible
      to deny,&rdquo; says Kampschulte, the Roman Catholic biographer of Calvin, &ldquo;that
      disorder and demoralisation had become threatening in Geneva; it would
      have been almost a miracle had it not been so.&rdquo; Farel did what he could.
      He founded schools. He organised the hospitals. He strove to kindle
      moral life in the people of his adopted city. But his talents and his
      character fitted him much more for pioneer work than for the task which
      now lay before him.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></p>
<p>Farel was a chivalrous Frenchman, born among the mountains of Dauphin&eacute;,
      whose courage, amounting to reckless daring, won for him the passionate
      admiration of soldiers like Wildermuth,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> and
      made him volunteer to lead any forlorn hope however desperate. He was
      sympathetic to soft-heartedness, yet utterly unable to restrain his
      tongue; in danger of his life one week because of his violent language,
      and the next almost adored, by those who would have slain him, for
      the reckless way in which he nursed the sick and dying during a visitation
      of the plague. He was the brilliant partisan leader, seeing only what
      lay before his eyes; incapable of self-restraint; a learned theologian,
      yet careless in his expression of doctrine, and continually liable
      to misapprehension. No one was better fitted to attack the enemy&rsquo;s
      strongholds, few less able to hold them when once possessed. He saw,
      without the faintest trace of jealousy&mdash;the man was too noble&mdash;others
      building on the foundations he had laid. It is almost pathetic to see
      that none of the Romance Swiss churches whose Apostle he had been,
      cared to retain him as their permanent leader. In the closing years
      of his life he went back to his beloved France, and ended as he had
      begun, a pioneer evangelist in Lyons, Metz, and elsewhere,&mdash;a
      leader of forlorn hopes, carrying within him a perpetual spring and
      the effervescing recklessness of youth. He had early seen that the
      pioneer life which he led was best lived without wife or children,
      and he remained unmarried until his sixty-ninth year. Then he met with
      a poor widow who had lost husband and property for religion&rsquo;s sake
      in Rouen, and had barely escaped with life. He married her because
      in no other way could he find for her a home and protection.</p>
<p>Geneva needed a man of altogether different mould of character to do the
      work that was now necessary. When Farel&rsquo;s anxieties and vexations were
      at their height, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg
      92]</a></span> learned almost by accident that a distinguished young
      French scholar, journeying from Ferrara to Basel, driven out of his
      direct course by war, had arrived in Geneva, and was staying for a
      night in the town. This was Calvin.</p>
<h3>&sect; 4. <i>Calvin: Youth and Education.</i></h3>
<p>Jean Cauvin (latinised into Calvinus) was born at Noyon in Picardy on
      the 10th of July 1509. He was the second son in a family of four sons
      and two daughters. His father, Gerard Cauvin, was a highly esteemed
      lawyer, the confidential legal adviser of the nobility and higher clergy
      of the district. His mother, Jeanne La France, a very beautiful woman,
      was noted for her devout piety and her motherly affection. Calvin,
      who says little about his childhood, relates how he was once taken
      by his mother on the festival of St. Anna to see a relic of the saint
      preserved in the Abbey of Ourscamp, near Noyon, and that he remembers
      kissing &ldquo;part of the body of St. Anna, the mother of the Virgin Mary.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>
<p>The Cauvins belonged to what we should call the upper middle class in
      social standing, and the young Jean entered the house of the noble
      family of de Montmor to share the education of the children, his father
      paying for all his expenses. The young de Montmors were sent to College
      in Paris, and Jean Cauvin, then fourteen years of age, went with them.
      This early social training never left Calvin, who was always the reserved,
      polished French gentleman&mdash;a striking contrast to his great predecessor
      Luther.</p>
<p>Calvin was a Picard, and the characteristics of the province were seen
      in its greatest son. The Picards were always independent, frequently
      strongly anti-clerical, combining in a singular way fervent enthusiasm
      and a cold tenacity of purpose. No province in France had produced
      so many sympathisers with Wiclif and Hus, and &ldquo;Picards&rdquo;
      was a term met with as frequently on the books of Inquisitors as &ldquo;Wiclifites,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hussites,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Waldenses&rdquo;&mdash;all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg
      93]</a></span> the names denoting dissenters from the medi&aelig;val
      Church who accepted all the articles of the Apostles&rsquo; Creed but were
      strongly anti-clerical. These &ldquo;brethren&rdquo; lingered in all the countries
      of Western Europe until the sixteenth century, and their influence
      made itself felt in the beginnings of the stirrings for reform.</p>
<p>Gerard Cauvin had early seen that his second son, Jean, was <i>de bon
            esprit, d&rsquo;une prompte naturelle &agrave; concevoir, et inventif
            en l&rsquo;estude des lettres humaines</i>,<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> and
            this induced him to give the boy as good an education as he could,
            and to destine him for the study of theology. His legal connection
            with the higher clergy of Noyon enabled him, in the fashion of
            the day, to procure for his son more than one benefice. The boy
            was tonsured, a portion of the revenue was used to pay for a
            curate who did the work, and the rest went to provide for the
            lad&rsquo;s education.</p>
<p>Young Calvin went with the three sons of the de Montmor family to the
      College de la Marche in Paris. It was not a famous one, but when Calvin
      studied there in the lowest class he had as his professor Mathurin
      Cordier, the ablest teacher of his generation.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> His
      aim was to give his pupils a thorough knowledge of the French and Latin
      languages&mdash;a foundation on which they might afterwards build for
      themselves. He had a singularly sweet disposition, and a very open
      mind. He was brought to know the Gospel by Robert Estienne, and in
      1536 his name was inscribed, along with those of Courat and Clement
      Marot, on the list of the principal heretics in Paris. Calvin was not
      permitted to remain long under this esteemed teacher. The atmosphere
      was probably judged to be too liberal for one who was destined to study
      theology. He was transferred to the more celebrated College de Montaigu.
      Calvin was again fortunate in his principal teachers. He became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg
      94]</a></span> the pupil of No&euml;l B&eacute;da and of Pierre Temp&ecirc;te,
      who taught him the art of formal disputation.</p>
<p>Calvin had come to Paris in his fourteenth year, and left it when he was
      nineteen&mdash;the years when a lad becomes a man, and his character
      is definitely formed. If we are to judge by his own future references,
      no one had more formative influence over him than Mathurin Cordier&mdash;short
      as had been the period of their familiar intercourse. Calvin had shown
      a singularly acute mind, and proved himself to be a scholar who invariably
      surpassed his fellow students. He was always surrounded by attached
      friends&mdash;the three brothers de Montmor, the younger members of
      the famous family of Cop, and many others. These student friends were
      devoted to him all his life. Many of them settled with him at Geneva.</p>
<p>Calvin left the College de Montaigu in 1528. Sometime during the same
      year another celebrated pupil entered it. This was Ignatius Loyola.
      Whether the two great leaders attended College together, whether they
      ever met, it is impossible to say&mdash;the dates are not precise enough.</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;Perhaps they crossed each other in some street of Mount Sainte-Genevi&egrave;ve:
            the young Frenchman of eighteen on horseback as usual, and the
            Spaniard of six and thirty on foot, his purse furnished with
            some pieces of gold he owed to charity, shoving before him an
            ass burdened with his books, and carrying in his pocket a manuscript,
            entitled <i>Exercitia Spiritualia</i>.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Calvin left Paris because his father had now resolved that his son should
      be a lawyer and not a theologian. Gerard Cauvin had quarrelled with
      the ecclesiastics of Noyon, and had even been excommunicated. He refused
      to render his accounts in two executry cases, and had remained obstinate.
      Why he was so, it is impossible to say. His children had no difficulty
      in arranging matters after his death. The quarrel ended the hopes of
      the father to provide well for his son in the Church, and he ordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg
      95]</a></span> him to quit Paris for the great law school at Orleans.
      It is by no means improbable that the father&rsquo;s decision was very welcome
      to the son. B&egrave;ze tells us that Calvin had already got some idea
      of the true religion, had begun to study the Holy Scriptures, and to
      separate himself from the ceremonies of the Church;<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>&mdash;perhaps
      his friendship with Pierre Robert Oliv&eacute;tan, a relation, a native
      of Noyon, and the translator of the Bible into French, had brought
      this about. The young man went to Orleans in the early part of 1528
      and remained there for a year, then went on to Bourges, in order to
      attend the lectures of the famous publicist, Andr&eacute; Alciat, who
      was destined to be as great a reformer of the study of law as Calvin
      was of the study of theology. In Orleans with its Humanism, and in
      Bourges with its incipient Protestantism, Calvin was placed in a position
      favourable for the growth of ideas which had already taken root in
      his mind. At Bourges he studied Greek under Wolmar, a Lutheran in all
      but the name, and dedicated to him long afterwards his <i>Commentary
      on the Second Epistle to the Corinthians</i>. He seems to have lived
      in the house of Wolmar; another inmate was Th&eacute;odore de B&egrave;ze,
      the future leader of the Protestants of France, then a boy of twelve.</p>
<p>The death of his father (May 26th, 1531) left Calvin his own master. He
      had obeyed the paternal wishes when he studied for the Church in Paris;
      he had obediently transferred himself to the study of law; he now resolved
      to follow the bent of his own mind, and, dedicating himself to study,
      to become a man of letters. He returned to Paris and entered the College
      Fortet, meaning to attend the lectures of the Humanist professors whom
      Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span>, under the guidance of Bud&eacute; and
      Cop, was attracting to his capital. These &ldquo;royal lecturers&rdquo; and their
      courses of instruction were looked on with great suspicion by the Sorbonne,
      and Calvin&rsquo;s conduct in placing himself under their instruction showed
      that he had already emancipated himself from that strict devotion to
      the &ldquo;superstitions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg
      96]</a></span> the Papacy&rdquo; to which he tells us that he was obstinately
      attached in his boyhood. He soon became more than the pupil of Bud&eacute;,
      Cop, and other Humanists. He was a friend, admitted within the family
      circle. He studied Greek with Pierre Dan&egrave;s and Hebrew under
      Vatable. In due time (April 1532), when barely twenty-three years of
      age, he published at his own expense his first book, a learned commentary
      on the two books of Seneca&rsquo;s <i>De Clementia</i>.</p>
<p>The book is usually referred to as an example of precocious erudition.
      The author shows that he knew as minutely as extensively the whole
      round of classical literature accessible to his times. He quotes, and
      that aptly, from fifty-five separate Latin authors&mdash;from thirty-three
      separate works of Cicero, from all the works of Horace and Ovid, from
      five comedies of Terence, and from all the works of Virgil. He quotes
      from twenty-two separate Greek authors&mdash;from five or six of the
      principal writings of Aristotle, and from four of the writings of Plato
      and of Plutarch. Calvin does not quote Plautus, but his use of the
      phrase <i>remoram facere</i> makes it likely that he was well acquainted
      with that writer also.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> The
      future theologian was also acquainted with many of the Fathers&mdash;with
      Augustine, Lactantius, Jerome, Synesius, and Cyprian. Erasmus had published
      an edition of Seneca, and had advised scholars to write commentaries,
      and young Calvin followed the advice of the Prince of Humanists. Did
      he imitate him in more? Did Calvin also disdain to use the New Learning
      merely to display scholarship, did he mean to put it to modern uses?
      Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span> was busy with one of his sporadic
      persecutions of the Huguenots when the book was published, and learned
      conjectures have been made whether the two facts had any designed connection&mdash;An
      exhortation addressed to an emperor to exercise clemency, and a king
      engaging in persecuting his subjects. Two things seem to show that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg
      97]</a></span> Calvin meant his book to be a protest against the persecution
      of the French Protestants. His preface is a daring attack on the abuses
      which were connected with the administration of justice in the public
      courts, and he says distinctly that he hopes the Commentary will be
      of service to the public.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>
<p>It seems evident from Calvin&rsquo;s correspondence that he had joined the small
      band of Protestants in Paris, and that he was intimate with Gerard
      Roussel, the Evangelical preacher,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> the
      friend of Marguerite of Navarre, of Lef&egrave;vre, of Farel, and a
      member of the &ldquo;group of Meaux.&rdquo; The question occurs, When did his conversion
      take place? This has been keenly debated;<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> but
      the arguments concern words more than facts, and arise from the various
      meanings attached to the word &ldquo;conversion&rdquo; rather than from the difficulty
      of determining the time. Calvin, who very rarely reveals the secrets
      of his own soul, tells in his preface to his <i>Commentary on the Psalms</i>,
      that God drew him from his obstinate attachment to the superstitions
      of the Papacy by a &ldquo;sudden conversion,&rdquo; and that this took place after
      he had devoted himself to the study of law in obedience to the wishes
      of his father. It does not appear to have been such a sudden and complete
      vision of divine graciousness as Luther received in the convent at
      Erfurt. But it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg
      98]</a></span> was a beginning. He received then some taste of true
      piety (<i>aliquo ver&aelig; pietatis gusto</i>). He was abashed to
      find, he goes on to relate, that barely a year afterwards, those who
      had a desire to learn what pure doctrine was gradually ranged themselves
      around him to learn from him who knew so little (<i>me novitium adhuc
      et tironem</i>). This was perhaps at Orleans, but it may have been
      at Bourges. When he returned to Paris to betake himself to Humanist
      studies, he was a Protestant, convinced intellectually as well as drawn
      by the pleadings of the heart. He joined the little band who had gathered
      round Estienne de la Forge, who met secretly in the house of that pious
      merchant, and listened to the addresses of Gerard Roussel. He was frequently
      called upon to expound the Scriptures in the little society; and a
      tradition, which there is no reason to doubt, declares that he invariably
      concluded his discourse with the words,
      &ldquo;If God be for us, who can be against us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was suddenly compelled to flee from Paris. The theologians of the Sorbonne
      were vehemently opposed to the
      &ldquo;royal lecturers&rdquo; who represented the Humanism favoured by Margaret,
      the sister of Francis, and Queen of Navarre. In their wrath they had
      dared to attack Margaret&rsquo;s famous book, <i>Miroir de l&rsquo;&acirc;me p&eacute;cheresse</i>,
      and had in consequence displeased the Court. Nicolas Cop, the friend
      of Calvin, professor in the College of Sainte Barbe, was Rector of
      the University (1533). He assembled the four faculties, and the faculty
      of medicine disowned the proceedings of the theologians. It was the
      custom for the Rector to deliver an address before the University yearly
      during his term of office, and Cop asked his friend Calvin to compose
      the oration.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Calvin
      made use of the occasion to write on
      &ldquo;Christian Philosophy,&rdquo; taking for his motto, &ldquo;<i>Blessed are</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg
      99]</a></span> <i>the poor in spirit</i>&rdquo; (Matt. v. 3). The discourse
      was an eloquent defence of Evangelical truth, in which the author borrowed
      from Erasmus and from Luther, besides adding characteristic ideas of
      his own. The wrath of the Sorbonne may be imagined. Two monks were
      employed to accuse the author of heresy before <i>Parlement</i>, which
      responded willingly. It called the attention of the King to papal Bulls
      against the Lutheran heresy. Meanwhile people discovered that Calvin
      was the real author, and he had to flee from Paris. After wanderings
      throughout France he found refuge in Basel (1535).</p>
<p>It was there that he finished his <i>Christian&aelig; Religionis Institutio</i>,
      which had for its preface the celebrated letter addressed to Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span> King
      of France. The book was the strongest weapon Protestantism had yet
      forged against the Papacy, and the letter &ldquo;a bold proclamation, solemnly
      made by a young man of six-and-twenty, who, more or less unconsciously,
      assumed the command of Protestantism against its enemies, calumniators,
      and persecutors.&rdquo; News had reached Basel that Francis, who was seeking
      the alliance of the German Lutheran Princes, and was posing as protector
      of the German Protestants, had resolved to purge his kingdom of the
      so-called heresy, and was persecuting his Protestant subjects. This
      double-dealing gave vigour to Calvin&rsquo;s pen. He says in his preface
      that he wrote the book with two distinct purposes. He meant it to prepare
      and qualify students of theology for reading the divine Word, that
      they may have an easy introduction to it, and be able to proceed in
      it without obstruction. He also meant it to be a vindication of the
      teaching of the Reformers against the calumnies of their enemies, who
      had urged the King of France to persecute them and drive them from
      France. His dedication was: <i>To His Most Gracious Majesty, Francis,
      King of France and his sovereign, John Calvin wisheth peace and salvation
      in Christ.</i> Among other things he said:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;I exhibit my confession to you that you may know the nature of
            that doctrine which is the object of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg
            100]</a></span> unbounded rage to those madmen who are now disturbing
            your kingdom with fire and sword. For I shall not be afraid to
            acknowledge that this treatise contains a summary of that very
            doctrine which, according to their clamours, deserves to be punished
            with imprisonment, banishment, proscription, and flames, and
            to be exterminated from the face of the earth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He meant to state in calm precise fashion what Protestants believed; and
      he made the statement in such a way as to challenge comparison between
      those beliefs and the teaching of the medi&aelig;val Church. He took
      the <i>Apostles&rsquo; Creed</i>, the venerable symbol of Western Christendom,
      and proceeded to show that when tested by this standard the Protestants
      were truer Catholics than the Romanists. He took this <i>Apostles&rsquo;
      Creed</i>, which had been recited or sung in the public worship of
      the Church of the West from the earliest times, which differed from
      other creeds in this, that it owed its authority to no Council, but
      sprang directly from the heart of the Church, and he made it the basis
      of his <i>Institutio</i>. For the <i>Institutio</i> is an expansion
      and exposition of the <i>Apostles&rsquo; Creed</i>, and of the four sentences
      which it explains. Its basis is: <i>I believe in God the Father; and
      in His Son Jesus Christ; and in the Holy Ghost; and in the Holy Catholic
      Church.</i> The <i>Institutio</i> is divided into four parts, each
      part expounding one of these fundamental sentences. The first part
      describes God, the Creator, or, as the Creed says: &ldquo;God, the Father
      Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth&rdquo;; the second, God the Son, the
      Redeemer and His Redemption; the third, God the Holy Ghost and His
      Means of Grace; the fourth, the Holy Catholic Church, its nature and
      marks.</p>
<p>This division and arrangement, based on the <i>Apostles&rsquo; Creed</i>, means
      that Calvin did not think he was expounding a new theology or had joined
      a new Church. The theology of the Reformation was the old teaching
      of the Church of Christ, and the doctrinal beliefs of the Reformers
      were those views of truth which were founded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg
      101]</a></span> on the Word of God, and which had been known, or at
      least felt, by pious people all down the generations from the earliest
      centuries. He and his fellow Reformers believed and taught the old
      theology of the earliest creeds, made plain and freed from the superstitions
      which medi&aelig;val theologians had borrowed from pagan philosophy
      and practices.</p>
<p>The first edition of the <i>Institutio</i> was published in March 1536,
      in Latin. It was shorter and in many ways inferior to the carefully
      revised editions of 1539 and 1559. In the later editions the arrangement
      of topics was somewhat altered; but the fundamental doctrine remains
      unchanged; the author was not a man to publish a treatise on theology
      without carefully weighing all that had to be said. In 1541, Calvin
      printed a French edition, which he had translated himself &ldquo;for the
      benefit of his countrymen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After finishing his <i>Institutio</i> (the MS. was completed in August
      1535, and the printing in March 1536), Calvin, under the assumed name
      of Charles d&rsquo;Espeville, set forth on a short visit to Italy with a
      companion, Louis du Tillet, who called himself Louis de Haulmont. He
      intended to visit Ren&eacute;e, Duchess of Ferrara, daughter of Louis <span class="smcap">XII.</span> of
      France, known for her piety and her inclination to the Reformed faith.
      He also wished to see something of Italy. After a short sojourn he
      was returning to Strassburg, with the intention of settling there and
      devoting himself to a life of quiet study, when he was accidentally
      compelled to visit Geneva, and his whole plan of life was changed.
      The story can best be told in his own words. He says in the preface
      to his <i>Commentary on the Psalms</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;As the most direct route to Strassburg, to which I then intended
            to retire, was blocked by the wars, I had resolved to pass quickly
            by Geneva, without staying longer than a single night in that
            city.... A person (Louis du Tillet) who has now returned to the
            Papists discovered me and made me known to others. Upon this
            Farel, who burned with an extraordinary zeal to advance the Gospel,
            immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg
            102]</a></span> strained every nerve to detain me. After having
            learnt that my heart was set upon devoting myself to private
            studies, for which I wished to keep myself free from other pursuits,
            and finding that he gained nothing by entreaties, he proceeded
            to utter an imprecation, that God would curse my retirement and
            the tranquillity of the studies which I sought, if I should withdraw
            and refuse assistance when the necessity was so urgent. By this
            imprecation I was so stricken with terror that I desisted from
            the journey which I had undertaken.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>&sect; 5. <i>Calvin with Farel in Geneva.</i></h3>
<p>Calvin was twenty-seven years of age and Farel twenty years older when
      they began to work together in Geneva; and, notwithstanding the disparity
      in age and utter dissimilarity of character, the two men became strongly
      attached to each other. &ldquo;We had one heart and one soul,&rdquo; Calvin says.
      Farel introduced him to the leading citizens, who were not much impressed
      by the reserved, frail young foreigner whose services their pastor
      was so anxious to secure. They did not even ask his name. The minute
      of the Council (Sept. 5th, 1536), giving him employment and promising
      him support, runs: &ldquo;Master William Farel stated the need for the lecture
      begun by <i>this Frenchman</i> in St. Peter&rsquo;s.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Calvin
      had declined the pastorate; but he had agreed to act as &ldquo;professor
      in sacred learning to the Church in Geneva (<i>Sacrarum literarum in
      ecclesia Genevensi professor</i>).&rdquo; His power was of that quiet kind
      that is scarcely felt till it has gripped and holds.</p>
<p>He began his work by giving lectures daily in St. Peter&rsquo;s on the Epistles
      of St. Paul. They were soon felt to be both powerful and attractive.
      Calvin soon made a strong impression on the people of the city. An
      occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg
      103]</a></span> arose which revealed him in a way that his friends
      had never before known. Bern had conquered the greater part of the
      Pays de Vaud in the late war. Its Council was determined to instruct
      the people of its newly acquired territory in Evangelical principles
      by means of a public Disputation, to be held at Lausanne during the
      first week of October.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> The
      three hundred and thirty-seven priests of the newly conquered lands,
      the inmates of the thirteen abbeys and convents, of the twenty-five
      priories, of the two chapters of canons, were invited to come to Lausanne
      to refute if they could the ten Evangelical <i>Theses</i> arranged
      by Farel and Viret.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> The
      Council of Bern pledged itself that there would be the utmost freedom
      of debate, not only for its own subjects, but &ldquo;for all comers, to whatever
      land they belonged.&rdquo; Farel insisted on this freedom in his own trenchant
      way: &ldquo;You may speak here as boldly as you please; <i>our</i> arguments
      are neither faggot, fire, nor sword, prison nor torture; public executioners
      are not our doctors of divinity.... Truth is strong enough to outweigh
      falsehood; if you have it, bring it forward.&rdquo; The Romanists were by
      no means eager to accept the challenge. Out of the three hundred and
      thirty-seven priests invited, only one hundred and seventy-four appeared,
      and of these only four attempted to take part. Two who had promised
      to discuss did not show themselves. Only ten of the forty religious
      houses sent representatives, and only one of them ventured to meet
      the Evangelicals in argument.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> As
      at Bern in 1528, as at Geneva in May 1535, so here at Lausanne in October
      1536, the Romanists showed themselves unable to meet their opponents,
      and the policy of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg
      104]</a></span> Bern in insisting on public Disputations was abundantly
      justified.</p>
<p>Farel and Viret were the Protestant champions. Farel preached the opening
      sermon in the cathedral on Oct. 1st, and closed the conference by another
      sermon on Oct. 8th. The discussion began on the Monday, when the huge
      cathedral was thronged by the inhabitants of the city and of the surrounding
      villages. In the middle of the church a space was reserved for the
      disputants. There sat the four secretaries, the two presidents, and
      five commissioners representing <i>les Princes Chretiens Messieurs
      de Berne</i>, distinguished by their black doublets and shoulder-knots
      faced with red, and by their broad-brimmed hats ornamented with great
      bunches of feathers,&mdash;hats kept stiffly on heads as befitting
      the representatives of such potent lords.</p>
<p>Calvin had not meant to speak; Farel and Viret were the orators; he was
      only there in attendance. But on the Thursday, when the question of
      the Real Presence was discussed, one of the Romanists read a carefully
      prepared paper, in the course of which he said that the Protestants
      despised and neglected the ancient Fathers, fearing their authority,
      which was against their views. Then Calvin rose. He began with the
      sarcastic remark that the people who reverenced the Fathers might spend
      some little time in turning over their pages before they spoke about
      them. He quoted from one Father after another,&mdash;&ldquo;Cyprian, discussing
      the subject now under review in the third epistle of his second book
      of Epistles, says ... Tertullian, refuting the error of Marcion, says
      ... The author of some imperfect commentaries on St. Matthew, which
      some have attributed to St. John Chrysostom, in the 11th homily about
      the middle, says ... St. Augustine, in his 23rd Epistle, near the end,
      says ... Augustine, in one of his homilies on St. John&rsquo;s Gospel, the
      8th or the 9th, I am not sure at this moment which, says ...&rdquo;;<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> and
      so on. He knew the ancient Fathers as no one else in the century. He
      had not taken their opinions second-hand from Peter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg
      105]</a></span> of Lombardy&rsquo;s <i>Sententi&aelig;</i> as did most of
      the Schoolmen and contemporary Romanist theologians. It was the first
      time that he displayed, almost accidentally, his marvellous patristic
      knowledge,&mdash;a knowledge for which Melanchthon could never sufficiently
      admire him.</p>
<p>But in Geneva the need of the hour was organisation and familiar instruction,
      and Calvin set himself to work at once. He has told us how he felt. &ldquo;When
      I came first to this church,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there was almost nothing. Sermons
      were preached;<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> the
      idols had been sought out and burned, but there was no other reformation;
      everything was in disorder.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> In
      the second week of January he had prepared a draft of the reforms he
      wished introduced. It was presented to the <i>Small Council</i> by
      Farel; the members had considered it, and were able to transmit it
      with their opinion to the <i>Council of the Two Hundred</i> on January
      15th, 1537. It forms the basis of all Calvin&rsquo;s ecclesiastical work
      in Geneva, and deserves study.</p>
<p>The memorandum treats of four things, and four only&mdash;the Holy Supper
      of our Lord (<i>la Saincte C&egrave;ne de Nostre Seigneur</i>), singing
      in public worship, the religious instruction of children, and marriage.</p>
<p>In every rightly ordered church, it is said, the Holy Supper ought to
      be celebrated frequently, and well attended. It ought to be dispensed
      every Lord&rsquo;s Day at least;<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> such
      was the practice in the Apostolic Church, and ought to be ours; the
      celebration is a great comfort to all believers, for in it they are
      made partakers of the Body and Blood of Jesus, of His death, of His
      life, of His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg
      106]</a></span> Spirit, and of all His benefits. But the present weakness
      of the people makes it undesirable to introduce so sweeping a change,
      and therefore it is proposed that the Holy Supper be celebrated once
      each month &ldquo;in one of the three places where sermons are now delivered&mdash;in
      the churches of St. Peter, St. Gervais, and de Rive.&rdquo; The celebration,
      however, ought to be for the whole Church of Geneva, and not simply
      for those living in the quarters of the town where these churches are.
      Thus every one will have the opportunity of monthly communion. But
      if unworthy partakers approach the Table of the Lord, the Holy Supper
      will be soiled and contaminated. To prevent this, the Lord has placed
      the <i>discipline de l&rsquo;excommunication</i> within His Church in order
      to maintain its purity, and this ought to be used. Perhaps the best
      way of exercising it is to appoint men of known worth, dwelling in
      different quarters of the town, who ought to be trusted to watch and
      report to the ministers all in their neighbourhood who despise Christ
      Jesus by living in open sin. The ministers ought to warn all such persons
      not to come to the Holy Supper, and the discipline of excommunication
      only begins when such warnings are unheeded.</p>
<p>Congregational singing of Psalms ought to be part of the public worship
      of the Church of Christ; for Psalms sung in this way are really public
      prayers, and when they are sung hearts are moved and worshippers are
      incited to form similar prayers for themselves, and to render to God
      the like praises with the same loving loyalty. But as all this is unusual,
      and the people need to be trained, it may be well to select children,
      to teach them to sing in a clear and distinct fashion in the congregation,
      and if the people listen with all attention and follow &ldquo;with the heart
      what is sung by the mouth,&rdquo; they will, &ldquo;little by little, become accustomed
      to sing together&rdquo; as a congregation.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></p>
<p>It is most important for the due preservation of purity of doctrine that
      children from their youth should be instructed how to give a reason
      for their faith, and therefore some simple catechism or confession
      of faith ought to be prepared and taught to the children. At
      &ldquo;certain seasons of the year&rdquo; the children ought to be brought before
      the pastors, who should examine them and expound the teachings of the
      catechism.</p>
<p>The ordinance of marriage has been disfigured by the evil and unscriptural
      laws of the Papacy, and it were well that the whole matter be carefully
      thought over and some simple rules laid down agreeable to the Word
      of God.</p>
<p>This memorandum, for it is scarcely more, was dignified with the name
      of the <i>Articles</i> (<i>Articuli de regimine ecclesi&aelig;</i>).
      It was generally approved by the <i>Small Council</i> and the <i>Council
      of Two Hundred</i>, who made, besides, the definite regulations that
      the Holy Supper should be celebrated four times in the year, and that
      announcements of marriages should be made for three successive Sundays
      before celebration. But it is very doubtful whether the Council went
      beyond this general approval, or that they gave definite and deliberate
      consent to Calvin&rsquo;s proposals about &ldquo;the discipline of excommunication.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These <i>Articles</i> were superseded by the famous <i>Ordonnances eccl&eacute;siastiques
            de l&rsquo;&Eacute;glise de Gen&egrave;ve</i>, adopted on Nov. 20th,
            1541; but as they are the first instance in which Calvin publicly
            presented his special ideas about ecclesiastical government,
            it may be well to describe what these were. To understand them
            aright, to see the <i>new</i> thing which Calvin tried to introduce
            into the Church life of the sixteenth century, it is necessary
            to distinguish between two things which it must be confessed
            were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg
            108]</a></span> practically entangled with each other in these
            days&mdash;the attempt to regulate the private life by laws municipal
            or national, and the endeavour to preserve the solemnity and
            purity of the celebration of the Holy Supper.</p>
<p>When historians, ecclesiastical or other, charge Calvin with attempting
      the former, they forget that there was no need for him to do so. Geneva,
      like every other medi&aelig;val town, had its laws which interfered
      with private life at every turn, and that in a way which to our modern
      minds seems the grossest tyranny, but which was then a commonplace
      of city life. Every medi&aelig;val town had its laws against extravagance
      in dress, in eating and in drinking, against cursing and swearing,
      against gaming, dances, and masquerades. They prescribed the number
      of guests to be invited to weddings, and dinners, and dances; when
      the pipers were to play, when they were to leave off, and what they
      were to be paid. It must be confessed that when one turns over the
      pages of town chronicles, or reads such a book as Baader&rsquo;s <i>N&uuml;rnberger
      Polizeiordnung</i>, the thought cannot help arising that the Civic
      Fathers, like some modern law-makers, were content to place stringent
      regulations on the statute-book, and then, exhausted by their moral
      endeavour, had no energy left to put them into practice. But every
      now and then a righteous fit seized them, and maid-servants were summoned
      before the Council for wearing silk aprons, or fathers for giving too
      luxurious wedding feasts, or citizens for working on a Church festival,
      or a mother, for adorning her daughter too gaily for her marriage.
      The citizens of every medi&aelig;val town lived under a municipal discipline
      which we would pronounce to be vexatious and despotic. Every instance
      quoted by modern historians to prove, as they think, Calvin&rsquo;s despotic
      interference with the details of private life, can be paralleled by
      references to the police-books of medi&aelig;val towns in the fifteenth
      and sixteenth centuries. To make them ground of accusation against
      Calvin is simply to plead ignorance of the whole municipal police of
      the later Middle Ages. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg
      109]</a></span> say that Calvin acquiesced in or approved of such legislation
      is simply to show that he belonged to the sixteenth century. When towns
      adopted the Reformation, the spirit of civic legislation did not change,
      but some old regulations were allowed to lapse, and fresh ones suggested
      by the new ideas took their place. There was nothing novel in the law
      which Bern made for the Pays de Vaud in 1536 (Dec. 24th), prohibiting
      dancing with the exception of
      &ldquo;trois danses hon&ecirc;tes&rdquo; at weddings; but it was a new
      regulation which prescribed that parents must bring their daughters
      to the marriage altar &ldquo;le chiefz couvert.&rdquo; It was not a new
      thing when Basel in 1530 appointed three honourable men (one from the
      Council and two from the commonalty) to watch over the morals of the
      inhabitants of each parish, and report to the Council. It was new,
      but quite in the line of medi&aelig;val
      civic legislation, when Bern forbade scandalous persons from approaching
      the Lord&rsquo;s Table (1532).</p>
<p>Calvin&rsquo;s thought moved on another plane. He was distinguished among the
      Reformers for his zeal to restore again the conditions which had ruled
      in the Church of the first three centuries. This had been a favourite
      idea with Lef&egrave;vre,<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> who
      had taught it to Farel, Gerard Roussel, and the other members of the &ldquo;group
      of Meaux.&rdquo; Calvin may have received it from Roussel; but there is no
      need to suppose that it did not come to him quite independently. He
      had studied the Fathers of the first three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg
      110]</a></span> centuries more diligently than any of his contemporaries.
      He recognised as none of them did that the Holy Supper of the Lord
      was the centre of the religious life of the Church, and the apex and
      crown of her worship. He saw how careful the Church of the first three
      centuries had been to protect the sacredness of the simple yet profound
      rite; and that it had done so by preventing the approach of all unworthy
      communicants. Discipline was the nerve of the early Church, and excommunication
      was the nerve of discipline; and Calvin wished to introduce both. Moreover,
      he knew that in the early Church it belonged to the membership and
      to the ministry to exercise discipline and to pronounce excommunication.
      He desired to reintroduce all these distinctive features of the Church
      of the first three centuries&mdash;weekly communion, discipline and
      excommunication exercised by the pastorate and the members. He recognised
      that when the people had been accustomed to come to the Lord&rsquo;s Table
      only once or twice in the year, it was impossible to introduce weekly
      communion all at once. But he insisted that the warnings of St. Paul
      about unworthy communicants were so weighty that notorious sinners
      ought to be prevented from approaching the Holy Supper, and that the
      obstinately impenitent should be excommunicated. This and this alone
      was the distinctive thing about Calvin&rsquo;s proposals; this was the new
      conception which he introduced.</p>
<p>Calvin&rsquo;s mistake was that, while he believed that the membership and the
      pastorate should exercise discipline and excommunication, he also insisted
      that the secular power should enforce the censures of the Church. His
      ideas worked well in the French Church, a Church &ldquo;under the cross,&rdquo; and
      in the same position as the Church of the early centuries. But the
      conception that the secular power ought to support with civil pains
      and penalties the disciplinary decisions of ecclesiastical Courts,
      must have produced a tyranny not unlike what had existed in the medi&aelig;val
      Church. Calvin&rsquo;s ideas, however, were never accepted save nominally
      in any of the Swiss Churches&mdash;not even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg
      111]</a></span> in Geneva. The very thought of excommunication in the
      hands of the Church was eminently distasteful to the Protestants of
      the sixteenth century; they had suffered too much from it as exercised
      by the Roman Catholic Church. Nor did it agree with the conceptions
      which the magistrates of the Swiss republics had of their own dignity,
      that they should be the servants of the ministry to carry out their
      sentences.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> The
      leading Reformers in German Switzerland almost universally held that
      excommunication, if it ever ought to be practised, should be in the
      hands of the civil authorities.</p>
<p>Zwingli did not think that the Church should exercise the right of excommunication.
      He declared that the example of the first three centuries was not to
      be followed, because in these days the &ldquo;Church could have no assistance
      from the Emperors, who were pagans&rdquo;; whereas in Zurich there was a
      Christian magistracy, who could relieve the Church of what must be
      in any case a disagreeable duty. His successor, Bullinger, the principal
      adviser of the divines of the English Reformation, went further. Writing
      to Leo Jud (1532), he declares that excommunication ought not to belong
      to the Church, and that he doubts whether it should be exercised even
      by the secular authorities; and in a letter to a Romance pastor (Nov.
      24th, 1543) he expounds his views about excommunication, and states
      how he differs from his <i>optimos fratres Gallos</i> (Viret, Farel,
      and Calvin).<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> The
      German Swiss Reformers took the one side, and the French Swiss Reformers
      took the other; and the latter were all men who had learned to reverence
      the usages of the Church of the first three centuries, and desired
      to see its methods of ecclesiastical discipline restored.</p>
<p>The people invariably sided with the German-speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg
                  112]</a></span> Reformers.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Calvin
                  managed, with great difficulty, to introduce excommunication
                  into Geneva after his return from exile, but not in a way
                  conformable to his ideas. Farel could not get it introduced
                  into Neuch&acirc;tel. He believed, founding on the New
                  Testament,<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> that
                  the membership of each parish had the right to exclude
                  from the Holy Supper sinners who had resisted all admonitions.
                  But the Council and community of Neuch&acirc;tel would
                  not tolerate the
      &ldquo;practice and usage of Excommunication,&rdquo; and did not allow it to appear
      in their ecclesiastical ordinances of 1542 or of 1553. Oecolampadius
      induced the Council of Basel to permit excommunication, and to inscribe
      the names of the excommunicate on placards fixed on the doors of the
      churches. Zwingli remonstrated vigorously, and the practice was abandoned.
      Bern was willing to warn open sinners from approaching the Lord&rsquo;s Table,
      but would not hear of excommunication, and declared roundly that &ldquo;ministers,
      who were sinners themselves, being of flesh and blood, should not attempt
      to penetrate into the individual consciences, whose secrets were known
      to God alone.&rdquo; Viret tried to introduce a <i>discipline eccl&eacute;siastique</i> into
      the Pays de Vaud, but was unable to induce magistrates or people to
      accept it. The young Protestant Churches of Switzerland, with the very
      doubtful exception of Geneva after 1541, refused to allow the introduction
      of the disciplinary usages of the primitive Church. They had no objection
      to discipline, however searching and vexatious, provided it was simply
      an application of the old municipal legislation, to which they had
      for generations been accustomed, to the higher moral requirements of
      religion.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> It
      was universally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg
      113]</a></span> recognised that the standard of moral living all over
      French Switzerland was very low, and that stringent measures were required
      to improve it. No exception was taken to the severe reprimand which
      the Council of Bern addressed to the subject Council of Lausanne for
      their failure to correct the evil habits of the people of that old
      episcopal town;<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> but
      such discipline had to be exercised in the old medi&aelig;val way through
      the magistrates, and not in any new-fangled fashion borrowed from the
      primitive Church. So far as Switzerland was concerned, Calvin&rsquo;s entreaties
      to model their ecclesiastical life on what he believed with Lef&egrave;vre
      to be the golden period of the Church&rsquo;s history, fell on heedless ears.
      One must go to the French Church, and in a lesser degree to the Church
      of Knox in Scotland, to see Calvin&rsquo;s ideas put in practice; it is vain
      to look for this in Switzerland.</p>
<p>The <i>Catechism</i> for children was published in 1537, and was meant,
      according to the author, to give expression to a simple piety, rather
      than to exhibit a profound knowledge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg
      114]</a></span> religious truth. But, as Calvin himself felt later,
      it was too theological for children, and was superseded by a second
      Catechism, published immediately after his return to Geneva in 1541.
      The first Catechism was entitled <i>Instruction and Confession of Faith
      for the use of the Church of Geneva</i>. It expounded successively
      the Ten Commandments, the Apostles&rsquo; Creed, the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, and the
      Sacraments. The duties of the pastorate and of the magistracy were
      stated in appendices.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>
<p>The <i>Confession of Faith</i> had for its full title, <i>Confession de
            la Foy laquelle tous bourgois et habitans de Gen&egrave;ve et
            subjectz du pays doyvent jurer de garder et tenir extraicte de
            l&rsquo;Instruction dont on use en l&rsquo;&Eacute;glise de la dicte ville</i>.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> It
            reproduced the contents of the <i>Instruction</i>, and was, like
            it, a condensed summary of the <i>Institutio</i>.</p>
<p>This Confession has often been attributed to Farel, but there can be little
      doubt that it came from the pen of Calvin.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> It
      was submitted to the Council and approved by them, and they agreed
      that the people should be asked to swear to maintain it, the various
      divisions of the districts of the town appearing for the purpose before
      the secretary of the Council. The proposal was then sent down to the
      Council of the Two Hundred, where it was assented to, but not without
      opposition. The minutes show that some members remained faithful to
      the Romanist faith. They said that they ought not to be compelled to
      take an oath which was against their conscience. Others who professed
      themselves Protestants asserted that to swear to a Confession took
      from them their liberty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg
      115]</a></span> &ldquo;We do not wish to be constrained,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;but
      to live in our liberty.&rdquo; But in the end it was resolved to do as the
      Council had recommended. So day by day the <i>dizenniers</i>, or captains
      of the divisions of the town, brought their people to the cathedral,
      where the secretary stood in the pulpit to receive the oath. The magistrates
      set the example, and the people were sworn in batches, raising their
      hands and taking the oath. But there were malcontents who stayed away,
      and there were beginnings of trouble which was to increase. Deputies
      from Bern, unmindful of the fact that their city had sworn in the same
      way to their creed, encouraged the dissentients by saying that no one
      could take such an oath without perjuring himself; and this opinion
      strengthened the opposition. But the Council of Bern disowned its deputies,<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> and
      refused any countenance to the malcontents, and the trouble passed.
      All Geneva was sworn to maintain the Confession.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the ministers of Geneva had been urging decision about the question
      of discipline and excommunication; and the murmurs against them grew
      stronger. The Council was believed to be too responsive to the pleadings
      of the pastors, and a stormy meeting of the General Council (Nov. 25th)
      revealed the smouldering discontent. On the 4th of January (1538) the
      Councils of Geneva rejected entirely the proposals to institute a discipline
      which would protect the profanation of the Lord&rsquo;s Table, by resolving
      that the Holy Supper was to be refused to no person seeking to partake.
      On the 3rd of February, at the annual election of magistrates, four
      Syndics were chosen who were known to be the most resolute opponents
      of Calvin and of Farel. The new Council did not at first show itself
      hostile to the preachers: their earliest minutes are rather deferential.
      But a large part of the citizens were violently opposed to the preachers;
      the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> Syndics
      were their enemies: collision was bound to come sooner or later.</p>
<p>It was at this stage that a proposal from Bern brought matters to a crisis.</p>
<p>The city contained many inhabitants who had been somewhat unwillingly
      dragged along the path of Reformation. Those who clung to the old faith
      were reinforced by others who had supported the Reformation simply
      as a means of freeing the city from the rule of the Prince Bishop,
      and who had no sympathy with the religious movement. The city had long
      been divided into two parties, and the old differences reappeared as
      soon as the city declared itself Protestant. The malcontents took advantage
      of everything that could assist them to stay the tide of Reformation
      and hamper the work of the ministers. They patronised the Anabaptists
      when they appeared in Geneva; they supported the accusation brought
      against Farel and Calvin by Pierre Caroli, that they were Arians because
      they refused to use the Athanasian Creed; above all, they declared
      that they stood for liberty, and called themselves Libertines. When
      Bern interfered, they hastened to support its ecclesiastical suggestions.</p>
<p>Bern had never been contented with the position in which it stood to Geneva
      after its conquest of the Pays de Vaud. When the war was ended, or
      rather before it was finished, and while the Bernese army of deliverance
      was occupying the town, the accompanying deputies of Bern had claimed
      for their city the rights over Geneva previously exercised by the Prince
      Bishop and the Vidomne or representative of the Duke of Savoy, whom
      their army had conquered. They claimed to be the overlords of Geneva,
      as they succeeded in making themselves masters of Lausanne and the
      Pays de Vaud. The people of Geneva resisted the demand. They declared,
      Froment tells us, that they had not struggled and fought for more than
      thirty years to assert their liberties, in order to make themselves
      the vassals of their allies or of anyone in the wide world.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg
      117]</a></span> Bern threatened to renounce alliance; but Geneva stood
      firm; there was always France to appeal to for aid. In the end Bern
      had to be content with much less than it had demanded.</p>
<p>Geneva became an independent republic, served heir to all the signorial
      rights of the Prince Bishop and to all his revenues, successor also
      to all the justiciary rights of the Vidomne or representative of the
      House of Savoy. It gained complete sovereignty within the city; it
      also retained the same sovereignty over the districts (<i>mandements</i>)
      of Penney, Jussy, and Thyez which had belonged to the Prince Bishop.
      On the other side, Bern received the district of Gaillard; Geneva bound
      itself to make no alliance nor conclude any treaty without the consent
      of Bern; and to admit the Bernese at all times into their city. The
      lordship over one or two outlying districts was divided&mdash;Geneva
      being recognised as sovereign, and having the revenues, and Bern keeping
      the right to judge appeals, etc.</p>
<p>It seemed to be the policy of Bern to create a strong State by bringing
      under its strict control the greater portion of Romance Switzerland.
      Her subject territories, Lausanne, a large part of the Pays de Vaud,
      Gex, Chablais, Orbe, etc., surrounded Geneva on almost every side.
      If only Geneva were reduced to the condition of the other Prince Bishopric,
      Lausanne, Bern&rsquo;s dream of rule would be realised. The Reformed Church
      was a means of solidifying these conquests. Over all Romance territories
      subject to Bern the Bernese ecclesiastical arrangements were to rule.
      Her Council was invariably the last court of appeal. Her consistory
      was reproduced in all these French-speaking local Churches. Her religious
      usages and ceremonies spread all over this Romance Switzerland. The
      Church in Geneva was independent. Might it not be brought into nearer
      conformity, and might not conformity in ecclesiastical matters lead
      to the political incorporation which Bern so ardently desired? The
      evangelist of almost all these Romance Protestant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg
      118]</a></span> Churches had been Farel. Their ecclesiastical usages
      had grown up under his guidance. It would conduce to harmony in the
      attempt to introduce uniformity with Bern if the Church of Geneva joined.
      Such was the external political situation to be kept in view in considering
      the causes which led to the banishment of Calvin from Geneva.</p>
<p>In pursuance of its scheme of ecclesiastical conformity, the Council of
      Bern summoned a Synod, representing most of the Evangelical Churches
      in western Switzerland, and laid its proposals before them. No detailed
      account of the proceedings has been preserved. There were probably
      some dissentients, of whom Farel was most likely one, who pled that
      the Romance Churches might be left to preserve their own usages. But
      the general result was that Bern resolved to summon another Synod,
      representing the Romance Churches, to meet at Lausanne (March 30th,
      1538). They asked (March 5th) the Council of Geneva to permit the attendance
      of Farel and Calvin.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> The
      letter reached Geneva on March 11th, and on that day the Genevan magistrates,
      unsolicited by Bern and without consulting their ministers, resolved
      to introduce the Bernese ceremonies into the Genevan Church. Next day
      they sent the letter of Bern to Farel and Calvin, and at the same time
      warned the preachers that they would not be allowed to criticise the
      proceedings of the Council in the pulpit. Neither Farel nor Calvin
      made any remonstrance. They declared that they were willing to go to
      Lausanne, asked the Council if they had any orders to give, and said
      that they were ready to obey them; and this although a second letter
      (March 20th) had come from Bern saying that if the Genevan preachers
      would not accept the Bern proposals they would not be permitted to
      attend the Synod.</p>
<p>Farel and Calvin accordingly went to the Synod at Lausanne, and were parties
      to the decision arrived at, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg
      119]</a></span> was to accept the usages of Bern&mdash;that all baptisms
      should be celebrated at stone fonts placed at the entrance of the churches;
      that unleavened bread should be used at the Holy Supper; and that four
      religious festivals should be observed annually, Christmas, New Year&rsquo;s
      Day, the Annunciation, and the Day of Ascension&mdash;with the stipulation
      that Bern should warn its officials not to be too hard on poor persons
      for working on these festival days.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>
<p>When the Council of Bern had got its ecclesiastical proposals duly adopted
      by the representatives of the various Churches interested, its Council
      wrote (April 15th) to the Council and to the ministers of Geneva asking
      them to confer together and arrange that the Church of Geneva should
      adopt these usages&mdash;the magistrates of Bern having evidently no
      knowledge of the hasty resolution of the Genevan Council already mentioned.
      The letter was discussed at a meeting of Council (April 19th, 1538),
      and several minutes, all relating to ecclesiastical matters, were passed.
      It was needless to come to any resolution about the Bern usages; they
      had been adopted already. The letter from Bern was to be shown to Farel
      and Calvin, and the preachers were to be asked and were to answer,
      yea or nay, would they at once introduce the Bern ceremonies? The preachers
      said that the usages could not be introduced at once. The third Genevan
      preacher, Elie Coraut, had spoken disrespectfully of the Council in
      the city, and was forbidden to preach, upon threat of imprisonment,
      until he had been examined about his words.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Lastly,
      it was resolved that the Holy Supper should be celebrated at once according
      to the Bern rites; and that if Farel and Calvin refused, the Council
      was to engage other preachers who would obey their orders.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></p>
<p>Coraut, the blind preacher, preached as usual (April 20th). He was at
      once arrested and imprisoned. In the afternoon, Farel and Calvin, accompanied
      by several of the most eminent citizens of Geneva, appeared before
      the Council to protest against Coraut&rsquo;s imprisonment, and to demand
      his release&mdash;Farel speaking with his usual daring vehemence, and
      reminding the magistrates that but for his work in the city they would
      not be in the position they occupied. The request was refused, and
      the Council took advantage of the presence of the preachers to ask
      them whether they would at once introduce the Bern usages. They replied
      that they had no objection to the ceremonies, and would be glad to
      use them in worship provided they were properly adopted,<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> but
      not on a simple order from the Council. Farel and Calvin were then
      forbidden to preach. Next day the two pastors preached as usual&mdash;Calvin
      in St. Peter&rsquo;s and Farel in St. Gervaise. The Council met to consider
      this act of disobedience. Some were for sending the preachers to prison
      at once; but it was resolved to summon the <i>Council of the Two Hundred</i> on
      the morrow (April 22nd) and the <i>General Council</i> on the 24th.
      The letters of Bern (March 5th, March 20th, April 15th) were read,
      and the Two Hundred resolved that they would &ldquo;live according to the
      ceremonies of Bern.&rdquo; What then was to be done with Calvin and Farel?
      Were they to be sent to the town&rsquo;s prison? No! Better to wait till
      the Council secured other preachers (it had been trying to do so and
      had failed), and then dismiss them. The General Council then met;<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> resolved
      to &ldquo;live according to the ceremonies of Bern,&rdquo; and to banish the three
      preachers from the town, giving them three days to collect their effects.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg
      121]</a></span> Calvin and Farel were sent into exile, and the magistrates
      made haste to seize the furniture which had been given them when they
      were settled as preachers.</p>
<p>Calvin long remembered the threats and dangers of these April days and
      nights. He was insulted in the streets. Bullies threatened to &ldquo;throw
      him into the Rhone.&rdquo;
      Crowds of the baser sort gathered round his house. They sang ribald
      and obscene songs under his windows. They fired shots at night, more
      than fifty one night, before his door&mdash;&ldquo;more than enough to astonish
      a poor scholar, timid as I am, and as I confess I have always been.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> It
      was the memory of these days that made him loathe the very thought
      of returning to Geneva.</p>
<p>The two Reformers, Calvin and Farel, left the town at once, determined
      to lay their case before the Council of Bern, and also before the Synod
      of Swiss Churches which was about to meet at Zurich (April 28th, 1538).
      The Councillors of Bern were both shocked and scandalised at the treatment
      the preachers had received from the Council of Geneva, and felt it
      all the more that their proposal of conformity had served as the occasion.
      They wrote at once to Geneva (April 27th), begging the Council to undo
      what they had done; to remember that their proposal for uniformity
      had never been meant to serve as occasion for compulsion in matters
      which were after all indifferent.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> Bern
      might be masterful, but it was almost always courteous. The secular
      authority might be the motive force in all ecclesiastical matters,
      but it was to be exercised through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg
      122]</a></span> machinery of the Church. The authorities of Bern had
      been careful to establish an ecclesiastical Court, the Consistory,
      of two pastors and three Councillors, who dealt with all ecclesiastical
      details. It encouraged the meeting of Synods all over its territories.
      Its proposals for uniformity had been addressed to both the pastors
      and the Council of Geneva, and had spoken of mutual consultation. They
      had no desire to seem even remotely responsible for the bludgeoning
      of the Genevan ministers. The Council of Geneva answered with a mixture
      of servility and veiled insolence<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> (April
      30th). Nothing could be made of them.</p>
<p>From Bern, Farel and Calvin went to Zurich, and there addressed a memorandum
      to a Synod, which included representatives from Zurich, Bern, Basel,
      Schaffhausen, St. Gallen, M&uuml;hlhausen, Biel (Bienne), and the two
      banished ministers from Geneva. It was one of those General Assemblies
      which in Calvin&rsquo;s eyes represented the Church Catholic, to which all
      particular Churches owed deference, if not simple obedience. The Genevan
      pastors presented their statement with a proud humility. They were
      willing to accept the ceremonies of Bern, matters in themselves indifferent,
      but which might be useful in the sense of showing the harmony prevailing
      among the Reformed Churches; but they must be received by the Church
      of Geneva, and not imposed upon it by the mere fiat of the secular
      authority. They were quite willing to expound them to the people of
      Geneva and recommend them. But if they were to return to Geneva, they
      must be allowed to defend themselves against their calumniators; and
      their programme for the organisation of the Church of Geneva, which
      had already been accepted but had not been put in practice (January
      16th, 1537),<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> must
      be introduced. It consisted of the following:&mdash;the establishment
      of an ecclesiastical discipline, that the Holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg
      123]</a></span> Supper might not be profaned; the division of the city
      into parishes, that each minister might be acquainted with his own
      flock; an increase in the number of ministers for the town; regular
      ordination of pastors by the laying on of hands; more frequent celebration
      of the Holy Supper, according to the practice of the primitive Church.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> They
      confessed that perhaps they had been too severe; on this personal matter
      they were willing to be guided.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> They
      listened with humility to the exhortations of some of the members of
      the Synod, who prayed them to use more gentleness in dealing with an
      undisciplined people. But on the question of principle and on the rights
      of the Church set over against the State, they were firm. It was probably
      the first time that the Erastians of eastern Switzerland had listened
      to such High Church doctrine; but they accepted it and made it their
      own for the time being at least. The Synod decided to write to the
      Council of Geneva and ask them to have patience with their preachers
      and receive them back again; and they asked the deputies from Bern
      to charge themselves with the affair, and do their best to see Farel
      and Calvin reinstated in Geneva.</p>
<p>The deputies of Bern accepted the commission, and the Geneva pastors went
      back to Bern to await the arrival of the Bern deputies from Zurich.
      They waited, full of anxiety, for nearly fourteen days. Then the Bern
      Council were ready to fulfil the request of the Synod.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> Deputies
      were appointed, and, accompanied by Farel and Calvin, set out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg
      124]</a></span> for Geneva. The two pastors waited on the frontier
      at Noyon or at Genthod while the deputies of Bern went on to Geneva.
      They had an audience of the Council (May 23rd), were told that the
      Council could not revoke what all three Councils had voted. The Council
      of the Two Hundred refused to recall the pastors. The Council General
      (May 26th) by a unanimous vote repeated the sentence of exile, and
      forbade the three pastors (Farel, Calvin, and Coraut) to set foot on
      Genevan territory.</p>
<p>Driven from Geneva, Calvin would fain have betaken himself to a quiet
      student life; but he was too well known and too much valued to be left
      in the obscurity he longed for. Strassburg claimed him to minister
      to the French refugees who had settled within its protecting walls.
      He was invited to attend the Protestant conference at Frankfurt; he
      was present at the union conferences at Hagenau, at Worms, and at Regensburg.
      There he met the more celebrated German Protestant divines, who welcomed
      him as they had done no one else from Switzerland. Calvin put himself
      right with them theologically by signing at once and without solicitation
      the Augsburg Confession, and aided thereby the feeling of union among
      all Protestants. He kindled in the breast of Melanchthon one of those
      romantic friendships which the frail Frenchman, with the pallid face,
      black hair, and piercing eyes, seemed to evoke so easily. Luther himself
      appreciated his theology even on his jealously guarded theory of the
      Sacrament of the Holy Supper.</p>
<p>Meanwhile things were not going well in Geneva. Outwardly, there was not
      much difference. Pastors ministered in the churches of the town, and
      the ordinary and ecclesiastical life went on as usual. The magistrates
      enforced the <i>Articles</i>; they condemned the Anabaptists, the Papists,
      all infringements of the sumptuary and disciplinary laws of the town.
      They compelled every householder to go to church. Still the old life
      seemed to be gone. The Council and the Syndics treated the new pastors
      as their servants, compelled them to render strict obedience to all
      their decisions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg
      125]</a></span> in ecclesiastical matters, and considered religion
      as a political affair. It is undoubted that the morals of the town
      became worse,&mdash;so bad that the pastors of Bern wrote a letter
      of expostulation to the pastors in Geneva,<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>&mdash;and
      the Lord&rsquo;s Supper seems to have been neglected. The contests between
      parties within the city became almost scandalous, and the independent
      existence of Geneva was threatened.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>
<p>At the elections the Syndics failed to secure their re-election. Men of
      more moderate views were chosen, and from this date (Feb. 1539) the
      idea began to be mooted that Geneva must ask Calvin to return. Private
      overtures were made to him, but he refused. Then came letters from
      the Council, begging him to come back and state his terms. He kept
      silence. Lausanne and Neuch&acirc;tel joined their entreaties to those
      of Geneva. Calvin was not to be persuaded. His private letters reveal
      his whole mind. He shuddered at returning to the turbulent city. He
      was not sure that he was fit to take charge of the Church in Geneva.
      He was in peace at Strassburg, minister to a congregation of his own
      countrymen; and the pastoral tie once formed was not to be lightly
      broken; yet there was an undercurrent drawing him to the place where
      he first began the ministry of the Word. At length he wrote to the
      Council of Geneva, putting all his difficulties and his longings before
      them&mdash;neither accepting nor refusing. His immediate duty called
      him to the conference at Worms.</p>
<p>The people of Geneva were not discouraged. On the 19th October, the <i>Council
            of the Two Hundred</i> placed on their register a declaration
            that every means must be taken to secure the services of &ldquo;Maystre
            Johan Calvinus,&rdquo; and on the 22nd a worthy burgher and member
            of the <i>Council of the Two Hundred</i>, Louis Dufour, was despatched
            to Strassburg with a letter from both the civic Councils, begging
            Calvin to return to his &ldquo;old place&rdquo; (<i>prestine plache</i>), &ldquo;seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg
            126]</a></span> our people desire you greatly,&rdquo; and promising
            that they would do what they could to content him.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Dufour
            got to Strassburg only to find that Calvin had gone to Worms.
            He presented his letters to the Council of the town, who sent
            them on by an express (<i>eques celeri cursu</i>)<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> to
            Calvin (Nov. 6th, 1540). Far from being uplifted at the genuine
            desire to receive him back again to Geneva, Calvin was terribly
            distressed. He took counsel with his friends at Worms, and could
            scarcely place the case before them for his sobs.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> The
            intolerable pain he had at the thought of going back to Geneva
            on the one hand, and the idea that Bucer might after all be right
            when he declared that Calvin&rsquo;s duty to the Church Universal clearly
            pointed to his return,<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> overmastered
            him completely. His friends, respecting his sufferings, advised
            him to postpone all decision until again in Strassburg. Others
            who were not near him kept urging him. Farel thundered at him
            (<i>constern&eacute; par tes foudres</i>).<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> The
            pastors of Zurich wrote (April 5th 1541):</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;You know that Geneva lies on the confines of France, of Italy,
            and of Germany, and that there is great hope that the Gospel
            may spread from it to the neighbouring cities, and thus enlarge
            the ramparts (<i>les boulevards</i>) of the kingdom of Christ.&mdash;You
            know that the Apostle selected metropolitan cities for his preaching
            centres, that the Gospel might be spread throughout the surrounding
            towns.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Calvin was overcome. He consented to return to Geneva, and entered the
      city still suffering from his repugnance to undertake work he was not
      at all sure that he was fitted to do. Historians speak of a triumphal
      entry. There may have been, though nothing could have been more distasteful
      to Calvin at any time, and eminently so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg
      127]</a></span> on this occasion, with the feelings he had. Contemporary
      documents are silent. There is only the minute of the Council, as formal
      as minutes usually are, relating that
      &ldquo;Maystre Johan Calvin, ministre evangelique,&rdquo; is again in charge of
      the Church in Geneva (Sept. 13th, 1541).<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>
<p>Calvin was in Geneva for the second time, dragged there both times unwillingly,
      his dream of a quiet scholar&rsquo;s life completely shattered. The work
      that lay before him proved to be almost as hard as he had foreseen
      it would be. The common idea that from this second entry Calvin was
      master within the city, is quite erroneous. Fourteen years were spent
      in a hard struggle (1541-55); and if the remaining nine years of his
      life can be called his period of triumph over opponents (1555-64),
      it must be remembered that he was never able to see his ideas of an
      ecclesiastical organisation wholly carried out in the city of his adoption.
      One must go to the Protestant Church of France to see Calvin&rsquo;s idea
      completely realised.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>
<p>On the day of his entry into Geneva (Sept. 13th, 1541) the Council resolved
      that a Constitution should be given to the Church of the city, and
      a committee was formed, consisting of Calvin, his colleagues in the
      ministry, and six members of the Council, to prepare the draft. The
      work was completed in twenty days, and ready for presentation. On September
      16th, however, it had been resolved that the draft when prepared should
      be submitted for revision to the <i>Smaller Council</i>, to the <i>Council
      of Sixty</i>, and finally to the <i>Council of Two Hundred</i>. The
      old opposition at once manifested itself within these Councils. There
      seem to have been alterations, and at the last moment Calvin thought
      that the Constitution would be made worthless for the purpose of discipline
      and orderly ecclesiastical rule. In the end, however, the drafted ordinances
      were adopted unanimously by the <i>Council of Two Hundred</i> without
      serious alteration.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg
      128]</a></span> The result was the famous <i>Ecclesiastical Ordinances
      of Geneva</i> in their first form. They did not assume their final
      form until 1561.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>
<p>When these <i>Ordinances</i> of 1541 are compared with the principles
      of ecclesiastical government laid down in the <i>Institutio</i>, with
      the <i>Articles</i> of 1537, and with the <i>Ordinances</i> of 1561,
      it can be seen that Calvin must have sacrificed a great deal in order
      to content the magistrates of Geneva.</p>
<p>He had contended for the self-government of the Church, especially in
      matters of discipline; the principle runs all through the chapters
      of the fourth book of the <i>Institutio</i>. The <i>Ordinances</i> give
      a certain show of autonomy, and yet the whole authority really rests
      with the Councils. The discipline was exercised by the <i>Consistory</i> or
      session of Elders (<i>Anciens</i>); but this Consistory was chosen
      by the <i>Smaller Council</i> on the advice of the ministers, and was
      to include two members of the <i>Smaller Council</i>, four from the <i>Council
      of Sixty</i>, and six from the <i>Council of Two Hundred</i>, and when
      they had been chosen they were to be presented to the <i>Council of
      Two Hundred</i> for approval. When the Consistory met, one of the four
      Syndics sat as president, holding his baton, the insignia of his magisterial
      office, in his hand, which, as the revised <i>Ordinances</i> of 1561
      very truly said, &ldquo;had more the appearance of civil authority than of
      spiritual rule.&rdquo; The revised <i>Ordinances</i> forbade the president
      to carry his baton when he presided in The Consistory, in order to
      render obedience to the distinction which is &ldquo;clearly shown in Holy
      Scripture to exist between the magistrate&rsquo;s sword and authority and
      the superintendence which ought to be in the Church&rdquo;; but the obedience
      to Holy Scripture does not seem to have gone further than laying aside
      the baton for the time. It appears also that the rule of consulting
      the ministers in the appointments made to the Consistory was not unfrequently
      omitted, and that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg
      129]</a></span> to all intents and purposes simply a committee of the
      Councils, and anything but submissive to the pastors.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> The
      Consistory had no power to inflict civil punishments on delinquents.
      It could only admonish and warn. When it deemed that chastisements
      were necessary, it had to report to the Council, who sentenced. This
      was also done in order to maintain the separation between the civil
      and ecclesiastical power; but, in fact, it was a committee of the Council
      that reported to the Council, and the distinction was really illusory.
      This state of matters was quite repugnant to Calvin&rsquo;s cherished idea,
      not only as laid down in the <i>Institution</i>, but as seen at work
      in the Constitution of the French Protestant Church, which was mainly
      his authorship.
      &ldquo;The magnificent, noble, and honourable Lords&rdquo; of the Council (such
      was their title) of this small town of 13,000 inhabitants deferred
      in <i>words</i> to the teachings of Calvin about the distinction between
      the civil and the spiritual powers, but in <i>fact</i> they retained
      the whole power of rule or discipline in their own hands; and we ought
      to see in the disciplinary powers and punishments of the Consistory
      of Geneva, not an exhibition of the working of a Church organised on
      the principles of Calvin, but the ordinary procedure of the Town Council
      of a medi&aelig;val city. Their petty punishments and their minute
      interference with private life are only special instances of what was
      common to all municipal rule in the sixteenth century.</p>
<p>Through that century we find a protest against the medi&aelig;val intrusion
      of the ecclesiastical power into the realm of civil authority, with
      the inevitable reaction which made the ecclesiastical a mere department
      of national or civic administration. Zurich under Zwingli, although
      it is usually taken as the extreme type of this Erastian policy, as
      it came to be called later, went no further than Bern, Strassburg,
      or other places. The Council of Geneva had legal precedent when they
      insisted that the supreme ecclesiastical power belonged to them. The
      city had been an ecclesiastical principality,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg
      130]</a></span> ruled in civil as well as in ecclesiastical things
      by its Bishop, and the Council were legally the inheritors of the Bishop&rsquo;s
      authority. This meant, among other things, that the old laws against
      heresy, unless specially repealed, remained on the Statute Book, and
      errors in doctrine were reckoned to be of the nature of treasonable
      things; and this made heresies, or variations in religious opinion
      from what the Statute Book had declared to be the official view of
      truth, liable to civil pains and penalties.</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;Castellio&rsquo;s doubts as to the canonicity of the Song of Songs and
            as to the received interpretation of Christ&rsquo;s descent into Hades,
            Bolsec&rsquo;s criticism of predestination, Gryet&rsquo;s suspected scepticism
            and possession of infidel books, Servetus&rsquo; rationalism and anti-Trinitarian
            creed, were all opinions judged to be criminal.... The heretic
            may be a man of irreproachable character; but if heresy be treason
            against the State,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>he was a criminal, and had to be punished for the crime on the Statute
      Book. To say that Calvin burnt Servetus, as is continually done, is
      to make one man responsible for a state of things which had lasted
      in western Europe ever since the Emperor Theodosius declared that all
      men were out of law who did not accept the Nicene Creed in the form
      issued by Damasus of Rome. On the other hand, to release Calvin from
      his share in that tragedy and crime by denying that he sat among the
      judges of the heretic, or to allege that Servetus was slain because
      he conspired against the liberties of the city, is equally unreasonable.
      Calvin certainly believed that the execution of the anti-Trinitarian
      was right. The Protestants of France and of Switzerland in 1903 (Nov.
      1st) erected what they called a <i>monument expiatoire</i> to the victim
      of sixteenth century religious persecution, and placed on it an inscription
      in which they acknowledged their debt to the great Reformer, and at
      the same time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg
      131]</a></span> condemned his error,&mdash;surely the right attitude
      to assume.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>
<p>Calvin did three things for Geneva, all of which went far beyond its walls.
      He gave its Church a trained and tested ministry, its homes an educated
      people who could give a reason for their faith, and to the whole city
      an heroic soul which enabled the little town to stand forth as the
      Citadel and City of Refuge for the oppressed Protestants of Europe.</p>
<p>The earlier preachers of the Reformed faith had been stray scholars, converted
      priests and monks, pious artisans, and such like. They were for the
      most part heroic men who did their work nobly. But some of them had
      no real vocation for the position into which they had thrust themselves.
      They had been prompted by such ignoble motives as discontent with their
      condition, the desire to marry or to make legitimate irregular connections,<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> or
      dislike to all authority and wholesome restraints. They had brought
      neither change of heart nor of conduct into their new surroundings,
      and had become a source of danger and scandal to the small Protestant
      communities.</p>
<p>The first part of the <i>Ordinances</i> was meant to put an end to such
      a condition of things, and aimed at giving the Reformed Church a ministry
      more efficient than the old priesthood, without claiming any specially
      priestly character.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg
      132]</a></span> The ministers were to be men who believed that they
      were called by the voice of God speaking to the individual soul, and
      this belief in a divine vocation was to be tested and tried in a threefold
      way&mdash;by a searching examination, by a call from their fellow-men
      in the Church, and by a solemn institution to office.</p>
<p>The examination, which is expressly stated to be the most important, was
      conducted by those who were already in the office of the ministry.
      It concerned, first, the knowledge which the candidate had of Holy
      Scripture, and of his ability to make use of it for the edification
      of the people; and, second, his walk and conversation in so far as
      they witnessed to his power to be an example as well as a teacher.
      The candidate was then presented to the <i>Smaller Council</i>. He
      was next required to preach before the people, who were invited to
      say whether his ministrations were likely to be for edification. These
      three tests passed, he was then to be solemnly set apart by the laying
      on of the hands of ministers, according to the usage of the ancient
      Church. His examination and testing did not end with his ordination.
      All the ministers of the city were commanded to meet once a week for
      the discussion of the Scriptures, and at these meetings it was the
      duty of every one, even the least important, to bring forward any cause
      of complaint he believed to exist against any of his brethren, whether
      of doctrine, or of morals, or of inefficient discharge of the duties
      entrusted to his care. The pastors who worked in the villages were
      ordered to attend as often as they could, and none of them were permitted
      to be absent beyond one month. If the meeting of ministers failed to
      agree on any matter brought before them, they were enjoined to call
      in the Elders to assist them; and a final appeal was always allowed
      to the Signory, or civil authority. The same rigid supervision was
      extended to the whole people, and in the visitations for this purpose
      Elders were always associated with ministers.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> Every
      member of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg
      133]</a></span> little republic, surrounded by so many and powerful
      enemies, was meant to be a soldier trained for spiritual as for temporal
      warfare. Calvin added a spiritual side to the military training which
      preserved the independence of the little medi&aelig;val city republics.</p>
<p>He was unwearied in his exertions to make Geneva an enlightened town.
      His educational policy adopted by the Councils was stated in a series
      of famous regulations for the management of the schools and College
      of the city.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> He
      sought out and presented to the Council the most noted scholars he
      could attract to Geneva. Mathurin Cordier, the ablest preceptor that
      France had produced in his generation; Beza, its most illustrious Humanist;
      Castellio and Saunier, were all teachers in the city. The fame of its
      schools attracted almost as many as persecution drove to take refuge
      within its walls. The religious instruction of the young was carefully
      attended to. Calvin&rsquo;s earlier Catechism was revised, and made more
      suitable for the young; and the children were so well grounded that
      it became a common saying that a boy of Geneva could give an answer
      for his faith as ably as a &ldquo;doctor of the Sorbonne.&rdquo; But what Geneva
      excelled in was its training for the ministry and other learned professions.
      Men with the passion of learning in their blood came from all lands&mdash;from
      Italy, Spain, England, Scotland, even from Russia, and, above all,
      from France. Pastors educated in Geneva, taught by the most distinguished
      scholars of the day, who had gained the art of ruling others in having
      learned how to command themselves, went forth from its schools to become
      the ministers of the struggling Protestants in the Netherlands, in
      England, in Scotland, in the Rhine Provinces, and, above all, in France.
      They were wise, indefatigable, fearless, ready to give their lives
      for their work, extorting praise from unwilling mouths, as modest,
      saintly,
      &ldquo;with the name of Jesus ever on their lips&rdquo; and His Spirit in their
      hearts. What they did for France and other countries must be told elsewhere.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></p>
<p>The once disorderly city, a prey to its own internal factions, became
      the citadel of the Reformation, defying the threats of Romanist France
      and Savoy, and opening its gates to the persecuted of all lands. It
      continued to be so for generations, and the victims of the <i>dragonnades</i> of
      Louis <span class="smcap">XIV.</span> received the welcome and protection
      accorded to the sufferers under the Valois in the sixteenth century.
      What it did for them may be best told in the words of a refugee:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;On the next day, a Sunday, we reached a small village on a hill
            about a league from Geneva, from which we could see that city
            with a joy which could only be compared to the gladness with
            which the Israelites beheld the Land of Canaan. It was midday
            when we reached the village, and so great was our eagerness to
            be as soon as possible within the city which we looked on as
            our Jerusalem, that we did not wish to stay even for food. But
            our conductor informed us that on the Sunday the gates of Geneva
            were never opened until after divine service, that is, until
            after four o&rsquo;clock. We had therefore to remain in the village
            until about that hour, when we mounted our horses again. When
            we drew near to the town we saw a large number of people coming
            out. Our guide was surprised, and the more so when, arriving
            at the Plain-Palais, a quarter of a league from the town, we
            saw coming to meet us, three carriages escorted by halberdiers
            and followed by an immense crowd of people of both sexes and
            of every age. As soon as we were seen, a servant of the Magistracy
            approached us and prayed us to dismount to salute respectfully
            &lsquo;Their Excellencies of Geneva,&rsquo; who had come to meet us and to
            bid us welcome. We obeyed. The three carriages having drawn near,
            there alighted from each a magistrate and a minister, who embraced
            us with tears of joy and with praises of our constancy and endurance
            far greater than we merited.... Their Excellencies then permitted
            the people to approach, and there followed a spectacle more touching
            than imagination could picture. Several of the inhabitants of
            Geneva had relatives suffering in the French galleys (from which
            we had been delivered), and these good people did not know whether
            any of them might be among our company. So one heard a confused
            noise, &lsquo;My son so and so, my husband, my brother, are you there?&rsquo;
            One can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg
            135]</a></span> imagine what embracings welcomed any of our troop
            who could answer. All this crowd of people threw itself on our
            necks with inexpressible transports of joy, praising and magnifying
            the Lord for the manifestation of His grace in our favour; and
            when Their Excellencies asked us to get on horseback again to
            enter the city, we were scarcely able to obey, so impossible
            did it seem to detach ourselves from the arms of these pious
            and zealous brethren, who seemed afraid to lose sight of us.
            At last we remounted and followed Their Excellencies, who conducted
            us into the city as in triumph. A magnificent building had been
            erected in Geneva to lodge citizens who had fallen into poverty.
            It had just been finished and furnished, and no one had yet lived
            in it. Their Excellencies thought it could have no better dedication
            than to serve as our habitation. They conducted us there, and
            we were soon on foot in a spacious court. The crowd of people
            rushed in after us. Those who had found relatives in our company
            begged Their Excellencies to permit them to take them to their
            houses&mdash;a request willingly granted. M. Bosquet, one of
            us, had a mother and two sisters in Geneva, and they had come
            to claim him. As he was my intimate friend, he begged Their Excellencies
            to permit him to take me along with him, and they willingly granted
            his request. Fired by this example, all the burghers, men and
            women, asked Their Excellencies to allow them the same favour
            of lodging these dear brethren in their own houses. Their Excellencies
            having permitted some to do this, a holy jealousy took possession
            of the others, who lamented and bewailed themselves, saying that
            they could not be looked on as good and loyal citizens if they

<h3>THE REFORMATION IN FRANCE.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></h3>
<h3>&sect; 1. <i>Marguerite d&rsquo;Angoul&ecirc;me and the &ldquo;group of Meaux.&rdquo;</i></h3>
<p>Perhaps no one so thoroughly represents the sentiments which inspired
      the beginnings of the movement for Reformation in France as Marguerite
      d&rsquo;Angoul&ecirc;me,<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> the
      sister of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg
      137]</a></span> King Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span> A study
      of her letters and of her writings&mdash;the latter being for the most
      part in verse&mdash;is almost essential for a true knowledge of the
      aspirations of the noblest minds of her generation. Not that she possessed
      creative energy or was herself a thinker of any originality, but her
      soul, like some clear sensitive mirror, received and reflected the
      most tremulous throb of the intellectual and religious movements around
      her. She had, like many ladies of that age, devoted herself to the
      New Learning. She had mastered Latin, Italian, and Spanish in her girlhood,
      and later she acquired Greek and even Hebrew, in order to study the
      Scriptures in their original tongues. In her the French Renaissance
      of the end of the fifteenth was prolonged throughout the first half
      of the sixteenth century. She was all sentiment and affection, full
      of that gentle courage which soft feminine enthusiasm gives, and to
      her brother and more masculine mother (Louise of Savoy)<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> she
      was a being to be protected against the consequences of her own tender
      daring. Contemporary writers of all parties, save the more bitter defenders
      of the prevalent Scholastic Theology, have something good to say about
      the pure, bright, ecstatic Queen of Navarre. One calls her the &ldquo;violet
      in the royal garden,&rdquo; and says that she unconsciously gathered around
      her all the better spirits in France, as the wild thyme attracts the
      bees.</p>
<p>Marsiglio Ficino had taught her to drink from the well of Christian Platonism;<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> and
      this mysticism, which had little to do with dogma, which allied itself
      naturally with the poetical sides of philosophy and morals which suggested
      great if indefinite thoughts about God,&mdash;<i>le Tout</i>, <i>le
      Seul N&eacute;cessaire</i>, <i>la Seule Bont&eacute;</i>,&mdash;the
      human soul and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg
      138]</a></span> intimate union between the two, was perhaps the abiding
      part of her ever-enlarging religious experience. Nicholas of Cusa,
      who tried to combine the old Scholastic with the new thoughts of the
      Renaissance, taught her much which she never unlearnt. She studied
      the Holy Scriptures carefully for herself, and was never weary of discussing
      with others the meaning of passages which seemed to be difficult. She
      listened eagerly to the preaching of Lef&egrave;vre and Roussel, and
      carried on a long private correspondence with Bri&ccedil;onnet, being
      passionately desirous, she said, to learn &ldquo;the way of salvation.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> Both
      Luther and Calvin made a strong impression upon her, but their schemes
      of theology never attracted nor subjugated her intelligence. Her sympathies
      were drawn forth by their disdain of Scholastic Theology, by their
      denial of the supernatural powers of the priesthood, by their proclamation
      of the power and of the love of God, and by their conception that faith
      unites man with God&mdash;by all in their teaching which would assimilate
      with the Christian mysticism to which she had given herself with all
      her soul. When her religious poems are studied, it will be found that
      she dwells on the infinite power of God, the mystical absorption of
      the human life within the divine, and praises passionately self-sacrifice
      and disdain of all earthly pleasures. She extols the Lord as the one
      and only Saviour and Intercessor. She contrasts, as Luther was accustomed
      to do, the Law which searches, tries, and punishes, with the Gospel
      which pardons the sinner for the sake of Christ and of the work which
      He finished on the Cross. She looks forward with eager hope to a world
      redeemed and regenerated through the Evangel of Jesus Christ. She insists
      on justification by faith, on the impossibility of salvation by works,
      on predestination in the sense of absolute dependence on God in the
      last resort. Works are good, but no one is saved by works; salvation
      comes by grace, and &ldquo;is the gift of the Most High God.&rdquo; She calls the
      Virgin the most blessed among women, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg
      139]</a></span> she had been chosen to be the mother of the &ldquo;Sovereign
      Saviour,&rdquo; but refused her any higher place; and in her devotions she
      introduced an invocation of Our Lord instead of the <i>Salve Regina</i>.
      This way of thinking about the Blessed Virgin, combined with her indifference
      to the Saints and to the Mass, and her undisguised contempt for the
      more superstitious ecclesiastical ceremonies, were the chief reasons
      for the strong attacks made on Marguerite by the Faculty of Theology
      (the Sorbonne) of Paris. She cannot be called a Protestant, but she
      had broken completely with medi&aelig;val modes of religious life and
      thought.</p>
<p>Marguerite&rsquo;s letters contain such graphic glimpses, that it is possible
      to see her daily life, whether at Bourges, where she held her Court
      as the Duchess of Alen&ccedil;on, or at N&eacute;rac, where she dwelt
      as the Queen of Navarre. Every hour was occupied, and was lived in
      the midst of company. Her <i>Contes</i> and her poetry were for the
      most part written in her litter when she was travelling from one place
      to another. Her &ldquo;Household&rdquo; was large even for the times. No less than
      one hundred and two persons&mdash;ladies, secretaries, almoners, physicians,
      etc.&mdash;made her Court; and frequently many visitors also were present.
      The whole
      &ldquo;Household,&rdquo; with the visitors, met together every forenoon in one
      of the halls of the Palace, a room &ldquo;well-paved and hung with tapestry,&rdquo; and
      there the Princess commonly proposed some text of Scripture for discussion.
      It was generally a passage which seemed obscure to Marguerite; for
      example, &ldquo;The meek shall inherit the earth.&rdquo; All were invited to make
      suggestions about its meaning. The hostess was learned, and no one
      scrupled to quote the Scriptures in their original languages, or to
      adduce the opinions of such earlier Fathers as Augustine, Jerome, Chrysostom,
      or the Gregories. If it surprises us to find one or other of the twenty <i>valets
      de chambre</i>, who were not menials and were privileged to be present,
      familiar with theology, and able to quote Greek and even Hebrew, it
      must not be forgotten that Marguerite&rsquo;s <i>valets de chambre</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg
      140]</a></span> included distinguished Humanists and Reformers, to
      whom she extended the protective privilege of being enrolled in her &ldquo;Household.&rdquo; When
      the weather permitted, the whole company went for a stroll in the park
      after the discussion, and then seated themselves near a &ldquo;pleasant fountain&rdquo; on
      the turf, &ldquo;so soft and delicate that they needed neither carpet nor
      cushions.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> There
      one of the ladies-in-waiting (thirty <i>dames</i> or <i>demoiselles</i> belonged
      to the &ldquo;Household&rdquo;) read aloud a tale from the <i>Heptameron</i>, not
      forgetting the improving conversation which concludes each story. This
      gave rise to an animated talk, after which they returned to the Palace.
      In the evening the &ldquo;Household&rdquo; assembled again in a hall, fitted as
      a simple theatre, to witness one of the Comedies or Pastorals which
      the Queen delighted to write, and in which, through a medium as strange
      as the <i>Contes</i>, she inculcated her mystical Christianity, and
      gave expression to her longings for a reformation in the Church and
      society. Her Court was the precursor of the <i>salons</i> which in
      a later age exercised such a powerful influence on French political,
      literary, and social life.</p>
<p>Marguerite is chiefly remembered as the author of the <i>Heptameron</i>,
      which modern sentiment cannot help regarding as a collection of scandalous,
      not to say licentious, tales. The incongruity, as it appears to us,
      of making such tales the vehicle of moral and even of evangelical instruction,
      causes us frequently to forget the conversations which follow the stories&mdash;conversations
      which generally inculcate moral truths, and sometimes wander round
      the evangelical thought that man&rsquo;s salvation and all the fruits of
      holy living rest on the finished work of Christ, the only Saviour. &ldquo;<i>Voil&agrave;,
      Mesdames, comme la foy du bon Comte ne fut vaincue par signes ne par
      miracles ext&eacute;rieurs, sachant tr&egrave;s bien que nous n&rsquo;avons
      qu&rsquo;un Sauveur, lequel en disant Consummatum est, a monstr&eacute; qu&rsquo;il
      ne laissoit point &agrave; un autre successeur pour faire notre salut.</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> So
      different was the sentiment of the sixteenth from that of the twentieth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg
      141]</a></span> century, that Jeanne d&rsquo;Albret, puritan as she undoubtedly
      was, took pains that a scrupulously exact edition of her mother&rsquo;s <i>Contes</i> should
      be printed and published, for all to read and profit by.</p>
<p>The Reformers with whom Marguerite was chiefly associated were called
      the &ldquo;group of Meaux.&rdquo; Guillaume Bri&ccedil;onnet,<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> Bishop
      of Meaux, who earnestly desired reform but dreaded revolution, had
      gathered round him a band of scholars whose idea was a reformation
      of the Church by the Church, in the Church, and with the Church. They
      were the heirs of the aspirations of the great conciliar leaders of
      the fifteenth century, such as Gerson, deeply religious men, who longed
      for a genuine revival of faith and love. They hoped to reconcile the
      great truths of Christian dogma with the New Learning, and at once
      to enlarge the sphere of Christian intelligence, and to impregnate
      Humanism with Christian morality.</p>
<p>The man who inspired the movement and defined its aims&mdash;&ldquo;to preach
      Christ from the sources&rdquo;&mdash;was Jacques Lef&egrave;vre d&rsquo;&Eacute;taples
      (Stapulensis).<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> He
      had been a distinguished Humanist, and in 1507 had resolved to consecrate
      his learning to a study of the Holy Scriptures. The first fruit of
      this resolve was a new Latin translation of the Epistles of St. Paul
      (1512), in which a revised version of the Vulgate was published along
      with the traditional text. In his notes he anticipated two of Luther&rsquo;s
      ideas&mdash;that works have no merit apart from the grace of God, and
      that while there is a Real Presence of Christ in the Sacrament of the
      Supper, there is no transubstantiation. The Reformers of Meaux believed
      that the Holy Scriptures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg
      142]</a></span> should be in the hands of the Christian people, and
      Lef&egrave;vre took Jean de R&eacute;ly&rsquo;s version of the Bible,&mdash;itself
      a revision of an old thirteenth century French translation,&mdash;revised
      it, published the Gospels in June 1523, and the whole of the New Testament
      before the end of the year. The Old Testament followed in 1525. The
      book was eagerly welcomed by Marguerite, and became widely known and
      read throughout France. The Princess was able to write to Bri&ccedil;onnet
      that her brother and mother were interested in the spread of the Holy
      Scriptures, and in the hope of a reform of the Church.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>
<p>Neither Lef&egrave;vre nor Bri&ccedil;onnet was the man to lead a Reformation.
      The Bishop was timid, and feared the
      &ldquo;tumult&rdquo;; and Lef&egrave;vre, like Marguerite, was a Christian mystic,<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> with
      all the mystic&rsquo;s dislike to change in outward and fixed institutions.
      More radical ideas were entering France from without. The name of Luther
      was known as early as 1518, and by 1520, contemporary letters tell
      us that his books were selling by the hundred, and that all thinking
      men were studying his opinions.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> The
      ideas of Zwingli were also known, and appeared more acceptable to the
      advanced thinkers in France. Some members of the group of Meaux began
      to reconsider their position. The Pope&rsquo;s Bull excommunicating Luther
      in 1520, the result of the Diet of Worms in 1521, and the declaration
      of the Faculty of Theology of the University of Paris (the Sorbonne)
      against the opinions of Luther, and their vindication of the authority
      of Aristotle and Scholastic Theology made it apparent that even modest
      reforms would not be tolerated by the Church as it then existed. The <i>Parlement</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg
      143]</a></span> of Paris (August 1521) ordered Luther&rsquo;s books to be
      given up.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>
<p>Lef&egrave;vre did not falter. He remained what he had been&mdash;a man
      on the threshold of a new era who refused to enter it. One of his fellow-preachers
      retracted his opinions, and began to write against his leader. The
      young and fiery Guillaume Farel boldly adopted the views of the Swiss
      Reformers. Bri&ccedil;onnet temporised. He forbade the preaching of
      Lutheran doctrine within his diocese, and the circulation of the Reformer&rsquo;s
      writings; but he continued to protect Lef&egrave;vre, and remained
      true to his teaching.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>
<p>The energetic action of the Sorbonne and of the <i>Parlement</i> of Paris
      showed the obstacles which lay in the path of a peaceful Reformation.
      The library of Louis de Berquin was seized and condemned (June 16th,
      1523), and several of his books burnt in front of Notre Dame by the
      order of <i>Parlement</i> (August 8th). Berquin himself was saved by
      the interposition of the King.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> In
      March 1525, Jean Leclerc, a wool-carder, was whipt and branded in Paris;
      and six months later was burnt at Metz for alleged outrages on objects
      of reverence. The Government had to come to some decision about the
      religious question.</p>
<p>Marguerite could write that her mother and her brother were &ldquo;more than
      ever well disposed towards the reformation of the Church&rdquo;;<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> but
      neither of them had her strong religious sentiment, and policy rather
      than conviction invariably swayed their action. The Reformation promoted
      by Lef&egrave;vre and believed in by Marguerite was at once too moderate
      and too exacting for Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span> It could
      never be a basis for an alliance with the growing Protestantism of
      Germany, and it demanded a purity of individual life ill-suited either
      with the personal habits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg
      144]</a></span> the King or with the manners of the French Court. It
      is therefore not to be wondered that the policy of the Government of
      Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span> wavered between a negligent protection
      and a stern repression of the French Reformers.</p>
<h3>&sect; 2. <i>Attempts to repress the Movement for Reform.</i></h3>
<p>The years 1523-26 were full of troubles for France. The Italian war had
      been unsuccessful. Provence had been invaded. Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span> had
      been totally defeated and taken prisoner at Pavia. Dangers of various
      kinds within France had also confronted the Government. Bands of marauders&mdash;<i>les
      aventuriers</i><a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>&mdash;had
      pillaged numerous districts; and so many conflagrations had taken place
      that people believed they were caused by emissaries of the public enemies
      of France. Louise of Savoy, the Queen-Mother, and Regent during her
      son&rsquo;s captivity in Madrid, had found it necessary to conciliate the
      formidable powers of the <i>Parlement</i> of Paris and of the Sorbonne.
      Measures were taken to suppress the printing of Lutheran and heretical
      books, and the <i>Parlement</i> appointed a commission to discover,
      try, and punish heretics. The result was a somewhat ineffective persecution.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> The
      preachers of Meaux had to take refuge in Strassburg, and Lef&egrave;vre&rsquo;s
      translation of the Scriptures was publicly burnt.</p>
<p>When the King returned from his imprisonment at Madrid (March 1525), he
      seemed to take the side of the Reformers. The Meaux preachers came
      back to France, and Lef&egrave;vre himself was made the tutor to the
      King&rsquo;s youngest son. In 1528-29 the great French Council of Sens met
      to consider the state of the Church. It reaffirmed most of the medi&aelig;val
      positions, and, in opposition to the teachings of Protestants, declared
      the unity, infallibility, and visibility of the Church, the authority
      of Councils,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg
      145]</a></span> the right of the Church to make canonical regulations,
      fasts, the celibacy of priests, the seven sacraments, the Mass, purgatory,
      the veneration of saints, the worship of images, and the Scholastic
      doctrines of free will and faith and works. It called on civil rulers
      to execute the censures of the Church on heretics and schismatics.
      It also published a series of reforms necessary&mdash;most of which
      were already contained in the canon law.</p>
<p>While the Council was sitting, the Romanists of France were startled with
      the news that a statue of the Blessed Virgin had been beheaded and
      otherwise mutilated. It was the first manifestation of the revolutionary
      spirit of the Reformation in France. The King was furious. He caused
      a new statue to be made in silver, and gave his sanction to the renewal
      of the persecutions (May 31st, 1528). Four years later his policy altered.
      He desired alliances with the English and German Protestants; one of
      the Reformers of Meaux preached in the Louvre during Lent (1533), and
      some doctors of the Sorbonne, who accused the King and Queen of Navarre
      of heresy, were banished from Paris. In spite of the ferment caused
      by the Evangelical address of Nicolas Cop, and the flight of Cop and
      of Calvin, the real author of the address, the King still seemed to
      favour reform. Evangelical sermons were again preached in the Louvre,
      and the King spoke of a conference on the state of religion within
      France.</p>
<p>The affair of the <i>Placards</i> caused another storm. On the morning
      of Oct. 18th, 1534, the citizens of Paris found that broadsides or <i>placards</i>,
      attacking in very strong language the ceremony of the Mass, had been
      affixed to the walls of the principal streets. These <i>placards</i> affirmed
      that the sacrifice of Christ upon the Cross was perfect and unique,
      and therefore could never be repeated; that it was sheer idolatry to
      say that the corporeal presence of Christ was enclosed within the wafer, &ldquo;a
      man of twenty or thirty years in a morsel of paste&rdquo;; that transubstantiation
      was a gross error; that the Mass had been perverted from its true meaning,
      which is to be a memorial of the sacrifice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg
      146]</a></span> and death of our Lord; and that the solemn ceremony
      had become a time &ldquo;of bell-ringings, shoutings, singing, waving of
      lamps and swinging of incense pots, after the fashion of sorcerers.&rdquo; The
      violence of language was extreme.
      &ldquo;The Pope and all his vermin of cardinals, of bishops, of priests,
      of monks and other hypocrites, sayers of the Mass, and all those who
      consent thereto,&rdquo; were liars and blasphemers. The author of this broadside
      was a certain Antoine Marcourt, who had fled from France and taken
      refuge in Neuch&acirc;tel. The audacity of the men who had posted the <i>placards</i> in
      Paris and in other towns,&mdash;Orl&eacute;ans, Blois, Amboise,&mdash;and
      had even fixed one on the door of the King&rsquo;s bedchamber, helped to
      rouse the Romanists to frenzy. The <i>Parlement</i> and the University
      demanded loudly that extreme measures should be taken to crush the
      heretics;<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> and
      everywhere expiatory processions were formed to protest against the
      sacrilege. The King himself and the great nobles of the Court took
      part in one in January,<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> and
      during that month more than thirty-five Lutherans were arrested, tried,
      and burnt. Several well-known Frenchmen (seventy-three at least), among
      them Clement Marot and Mathurin Cordier, fled the country, and their
      possessions were confiscated.</p>
<p>After this outburst of persecution the King&rsquo;s policy again changed. He
      was once more anxious for an alliance with the Protestants of Germany.
      An amnesty was proclaimed for all save the &ldquo;Sacramentarians,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> the
      followers of Zwingli. A few of the exiled Frenchmen returned, among
      them Clement Marot. The Chancellor of France, Antoine du Bourg, went
      the length of inviting the German theologians to come to France for
      the purpose of sharing in a religious conference, and adhered to his
      proposal in spite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg
      147]</a></span> of the protests of the Sorbonne. But nothing came of
      it. The German Protestant theologians refused to risk themselves on
      French soil; and the exiled Frenchmen mistrusted the King and his Chancellor.
      The amnesty, however, deserves remark, because it called forth the
      letter of Calvin to Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span> which forms
      the &ldquo;dedication&rdquo; or preface to his <i>Christian Institution</i>.</p>
<p>The work of repression was resumed with increased severity. Royal edicts
      and mandates urging the extirpation of heresy followed each other in
      rapid succession&mdash;Edict to the <i>Parlement</i> of Toulouse (Dec.
      16th, 1538), to the <i>Parlements</i> of Toulouse, Bordeaux, and Rouen
      (June 24th, 1539); a general edict issued from Fontainebleau (June
      1st, 1540); an edict to the <i>Parlement</i> of Toulouse (Aug. 29th,
      1542); <i>mandats</i> to the <i>Parlements</i> of Paris, Bordeaux,
      Dijon, Grenoble, and Rouen (Aug. 30th, 1542). The general Edict of
      Fontainebleau was one of exceptional severity. It was intended to introduce
      a more summary procedure in heresy trials, and enjoined officials to
      proceed against all persons tainted with heresy, even against ecclesiastics
      or those who had the &ldquo;benefit of clergy&rdquo;; the right of appeal was denied
      to those suspected; negligent judges were threatened with the King&rsquo;s
      displeasure; and the ecclesiastical courts were urged to show greater
      zeal, and to take advantage of the powers given to the civil courts.
      &ldquo;Every loyal subject,&rdquo; the edict said, &ldquo;must denounce heretics, and
      employ all means to root them out, just as all men are bound to run
      to help to extinguish a public conflagration.&rdquo;
      This edict, slightly modified by the <i>Parlement</i> of Paris (July
      1543) by enlarging the powers of the ecclesiastical courts, remained
      in force in France for the nine following years. Yet in spite of its
      thoroughness, succeeding edicts and <i>mandats</i> declare that heresy
      was making rapid progress in France.</p>
<p>The Sorbonne and the <i>Parlements</i> (especially those of Paris and
      Aix) urged on the persecution of the &ldquo;Lutherans.&rdquo;
      The former drafted a series of twenty-five articles (a refutation of
      the 1541 edition of Calvin&rsquo;s <i>Institution</i>), which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg
      148]</a></span> meant to assert concisely the dogma of the Church,
      and to deny whatever the Reformers taught prejudicial to the doctrines
      and practices of the medi&aelig;val Church. These articles were approved
      by the King and his Privy Council, who ordered them to be published
      throughout the whole kingdom, and gave instructions to deal with all
      who preached or taught anything contrary or repugnant to them. This
      ordinance was at once registered by the <i>Parlement</i> of Paris.
      Thus all the powers of the realm committed themselves to a struggle
      to extirpate the Reformed teaching, and were armed with a test which
      was at once clear and comprehensive. Not content with this, the Sorbonne
      began a list of prohibited books (1542-43)&mdash;a list containing
      the works of Calvin, Luther, Melanchthon, Clement Marot, and the translations
      of scripture edited by Robert Estienne, and the <i>Parlement</i> issued
      a severe ordinance against all Protestant propaganda by means of printing
      or the selling of books (July 1542).</p>
<p>These various ordinances for the extirpation of heresy were applied promptly
      and rigorously, and the fires of persecution were soon kindled all
      over France. The <i>place</i> Maubert was the scene of the martyrdoms
      in Paris. There were no great <i>auto-da-f&eacute;s</i>, but continual
      mention is made of burning two or three martyrs at once. Two acts of
      persecution cast a dark stain on the last years of Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span>&mdash;the
      slaughter of the Waldenses of the Durance in 1545, and the martyrdom
      of the &ldquo;fourteen of Meaux.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A portion of Provence, skirting the Durance where that river is about
      to flow into the Rhone, had been almost depopulated in the fourteenth
      century, and the landowners had invited peasants from the Alps to settle
      within their territories. The incomers were Waldenses; their religion
      was guaranteed protection, and their industry and thrift soon covered
      the desolate region with fertile farms. When the Reformation movement
      had established itself in Germany and Switzerland, these villagers
      were greatly interested. They drew up a brief statement of what they
      believed, and sent it to the leading Reformers, accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg
      149]</a></span> by a number of questions on matters of religion. They
      received long answers from Bucer and from Oecolampadius, and, having
      met in conference (Sept. 1532) at Angrogne in Piedmont, they drafted
      a simple confession of faith based on the replies of the Reformers
      to their questions. It was natural that they should view the progress
      of the Reformation within France with interest, and that they should
      contribute 500 crowns to defray the expense of printing a new translation
      of the Scriptures into French by Robert Oliv&eacute;tan. Freedom to
      practise their religion had been granted for two centuries to the inhabitants
      of the thirty Waldensian villages, and they conceived that in exhibiting
      their sympathy with French Protestantism they were acting within their
      ancient rights. Jean de Roma, Inquisitor for Provence, thought otherwise.
      In 1532 he began to exhort the villagers to abjure their opinions;
      and, finding his entreaties without effect, he set on foot a severe
      persecution. The Waldenses appealed to the King, who sent a commission
      to inquire into the matter, with the result that Jean de Roma was compelled
      to flee the country.</p>
<p>The persecution was renewed in 1535 by the Archbishop and <i>Parlement</i> of
      Aix, who cited seventeen of the people of Merindol, one of the villages,
      before them on a charge of heresy. When they failed to appear, the <i>Parlement</i> published
      (Nov. 18th, 1540) the celebrated <i>Arr&ecirc;t de Merindol</i>, which
      sentenced the seventeen to be burnt at the stake. The Waldenses again
      appealed to the King, who pardoned the seventeen on the condition that
      they should abjure their heresy within three months (Feb. 8th, 1541).
      There was a second appeal to the King, who again protected the Waldenses;
      but during the later months of 1541 the <i>Parlement</i> of Aix sent
      to His Majesty the false information that the people of Merindol were
      in open insurrection, and were threatening to sack the town of Marseilles.
      Upon this, Francis, urged thereto by Cardinal de Tournon, recalled
      his protection, and ordered all the Waldenses to be exterminated (Jan.
      1st, 1545). An army was stealthily organised, and during seven weeks
      of slaughter, amid all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg
      150]</a></span> the accompaniments of treachery and brutality, twenty-two
      of the thirty Waldensian villages were utterly destroyed, between three
      and four thousand men and women were slain, and seven hundred men sent
      to the galleys. Those who escaped took refuge in Switzerland.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>
<p>The persecution at Meaux (1546) was more limited in extent, but was accompanied
      by such tortures that it formed a fitting introduction to the severities
      of the reign of Henri <span class="smcap">II.</span></p>
<p>The Reformed at Meaux had organised themselves into a congregation modelled
      on that of the French refugees in Strassburg. They had chosen Pierre
      Leclerc to be their pastor, and one of their number, &Eacute;tienne
      Mangin, gave his house for the meetings of the congregation. The authorities
      heard of the meetings, and on Sept 8th, 1546, a sudden visit was made
      to the house, and sixty-one persons were arrested and brought before
      the <i>Parlement</i> of Paris. Their special crime was that they had
      engaged in the celebration of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper. The sentence of the
      Court declared that the Bishop of Meaux had shown culpable negligence
      in permitting such meetings; that the evidence indicated that there
      were numbers of &ldquo;Lutherans&rdquo; and heretics in Meaux besides those brought
      before it, and that all such were to be sought out; that all books
      in the town which concerned the Christian religion were to be deposited
      in the record-office within eight days; that special sermons were to
      be delivered and expiatory processions organised; and that the house
      of &Eacute;tienne Mangin was to be razed to the ground, and a chapel
      in honour of the Holy Sacrament erected on the site. It condemned fourteen
      of the accused to be burnt alive, after having suffered the severest
      tortures which the law permitted; five to be hung up by the armpits
      to witness the execution, and then to be scourged and imprisoned; others
      to witness the execution with cords round their necks and with their
      heads bare, to ask pardon for their crime, to take part in an expiatory
      procession, and to listen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg
      151]</a></span> to a sermon on the adoration due to the Body of Christ
      present in the Holy Sacrament. A few, mostly women, were acquitted.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>
<p>Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span> died in March 1547. The persistent
      persecution which had marked the later years of his reign had done
      little or nothing to quench the growing Protestantism of France. It
      had only succeeded in driving it beneath the surface.</p>
<p>Henry <span class="smcap">II.</span> never indulged in the vacillating
      policy of his father. From the beginning of his reign he set himself
      resolutely to combat the Reformation. His favourite councillors&mdash;his
      all-powerful mistress, Diane of Poitiers; his chief Minister, the Constable
      Montmorency, in high repute for his skill in the arts of war and of
      government; the Guises, a great family, originally belonging to Lorraine,
      who had risen to power in France&mdash;were all strong supporters of
      the Roman Catholic religion, and resolute to destroy the growing Protestantism
      of France. The declared policy of the King was to slay the Reformation
      by attacking it through every form of legal suppression that could
      be devised.</p>
<h3>&sect; 3. <i>Change in the Character of the Movement for Reform.</i></h3>
<p>The task was harder than it had been during the reign of Francis. In spite
      of the persecutions, the adherents of the new faith had gone on increasing
      in a wonderful way. Many of the priests and monks had been converted
      to Evangelical doctrines. They taught them secretly and openly; and
      they could expose in a telling way the corruptions of the Church, having
      known them from the inside. Schoolmasters, if one may judge from the <i>arr&eacute;ts</i> of
      the <i>Parlements</i>, were continually blamed for dissuading their
      pupils from going to Mass, and for corrupting the youth by instructing
      them in the &ldquo;false and pernicious doctrines of Geneva.&rdquo;
      Many Colleges were named as seed-beds of the Reformation&mdash;Angers,
      Bourges, Fontenay, La Rochelle, Loudun, Niort, Nimes, and Poitiers.
      The theatre itself became an agent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg
      152]</a></span> for reform when the corruptions of the Church and the
      morals of the clergy were attacked in popular plays. The refugees in
      Strassburg, Geneva, and Lausanne spared no pains to send the Evangelical
      doctrines to their countrymen. Ardent young Frenchmen, trained abroad,
      took their lives in their hand, and crept quietly through the length
      and breadth of France. They met converts and inquirers in solitary
      suburbs, in cellars of houses, on highways, and by the rivers. The
      records of the ecclesiastical police enable us to trace the spread
      of the Reformation along the great roads and waterways of France. The
      missioners changed their names frequently to elude observation. Some,
      with a daring beyond their fellows, did not hesitate to visit the towns
      and preach almost openly to the people. The propaganda carried on by
      colporteurs was scarcely less successful. These were usually young
      men trained at Geneva or Strassburg. They carried their books in a
      pack on their backs, and hawked them in village and town, describing
      their contents, and making little sermons for the listeners. Among
      the notices of seizures we find such titles as the following:&mdash;<i>Les
      Colloques</i> of Erasmus, <i>La Fontaine de Vie</i> (a selection of
      scriptural passages translated into French), the <i>Livre de vraye
      et parfaicte oraison</i> (a translation of extracts from Luther&rsquo;s writings),
      the <i>Cinquante-deux psaumes</i>, the <i>Cat&eacute;chisme de Gen&egrave;ve,
      Pri&egrave;res eccl&eacute;siastiques avec la mani&egrave;re d&rsquo;administrer
      les sacrements</i>, an <i>Alphabet chr&eacute;tien</i> and an <i>Instruction
      chr&eacute;tienne pour les petits enfants</i>. No edicts against printing
      books which had not been submitted to the ecclesiastical authorities
      were able to put an end to this secret colportage.</p>
<p>In these several ways the Evangelical faith was spread abroad, and before
      the death of Francis there was not a district in France with the single
      exception of Brittany which had not its secret Protestants, while many
      parts of the country swarmed with them.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></p>
<h3>&sect; 4. <i>Calvin and his Influence in France.</i></h3>
<p>The Reformation in France had been rapidly changing its character since
      1536, the year in which Lef&egrave;vre died, and in which Calvin&rsquo;s <i>Christian
      Institution</i> was published. It was no longer a Christian mysticism
      supplemented by a careful study of the Scriptures; it had advanced
      beyond the stage of individual followers of Luther or Zwingli; it had
      become united, presenting a solid phalanx to its foes; it had rallied
      round a manifesto which was at once a completed scheme of doctrine,
      a prescribed mode of worship, and a code of morals; it had found a
      leader who was both a master and a commander-in-chief. The publication
      of the <i>Christian Institution</i> had effected this. The young man
      whom the Town Council of Geneva could speak of as &ldquo;a certain Frenchman&rdquo; (<i>Gallus
      quidam</i>) soon took a foremost place among the leaders of the whole
      Reformation movement, and moulded in his plastic hands the Reformation
      in France.</p>
<p>Calvin&rsquo;s early life and his work in Geneva have already been described;
      but his special influence on France must not pass unnoticed.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> He
      had an extraordinary power over his co-religionists in his native land.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> He
      was a Frenchman&mdash;one of themselves; no foreigner speaking an unfamiliar
      tongue; no enemy of the Fatherland to follow whom might seem to be
      unpatriotic. It is true that his fixed abode lay beyond the confines
      of France; but distance, which gave him freedom of action, made him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg
      154]</a></span> the more esteemed. He was the apostle who wrote &ldquo;to
      all that be in France, beloved of God, called to be saints.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While still a student, Calvin had shown that he possessed, besides a marvellous
      memory, an acute and penetrating intellect, with a great faculty for
      assimilating ideas and modes of thought; but he lacked what may be
      called artistic imagination,<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> and
      neither poetry nor art seemed to strike any responsive chord in his
      soul. His conduct was always straightforward, irreproachable, and dignified;
      he was by education and breeding, if not by descent, the polished French
      gentleman, and was most at home with men and women of noble birth.
      His character was serious, with little playfulness, little vivacity,
      but with a wonderful power of sympathy. He was reserved, somewhat shy,
      slow to make intimate friends, but once made the friendships lasted
      for life. At all periods of age, boy, student, man of letters, leader
      of a great party, he seems to have been a centre of attraction and
      of deferential trust. The effect of this mysterious charm was felt
      by others besides those of his own age. His professor, Mathurin Cordier,
      became his devoted disciple. Melanchthon wished that he might die with
      his head on Calvin&rsquo;s breast. Luther, in spite of his suspicion of everything
      that came from Switzerland, was won to love and trust him. And Knox,
      the most rugged and independent of men, acknowledged Calvin as his
      master, consulted him in every doubt and difficulty, and on all occasions
      save one meekly followed his counsels. He loved children, and had them
      at his house for Christmas trees; but (and this is characteristically
      French) always addressed them with ceremonious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg
      155]</a></span> politeness, as if they were grown men and women deserving
      as much consideration as himself. It was this trait that captivated
      de B&egrave;ze when he was a boy of twelve.</p>
<p>Calvin was a democrat intellectually and by silent principle. This appears
      almost everywhere in his private writings, and was noted by such a
      keen observer as Tavannes. It was never more unconsciously displayed
      than in the preface or dedication of the <i>Christian Institution</i>.</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;This preface, instead of pleading with the King on behalf of the
            Reformation, places the movement right before him, and makes
            him see it. Its tone throughout firm and dignified, calm and
            stately when Calvin addresses Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span> directly,
            more bitter and sarcastic when he is speaking of theologians, <i>la
            pens&eacute;e et la forme du style toutes vibrantes du ton biblique</i>,
            the very simplicity and perfect frankness of the address, give
            the impression of one who is speaking on equal terms with his
            peer. All suggest the Christian democrat without a trace of the
            revolutionary.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The source of his power&mdash;logic impregnated by the passion of conviction&mdash;is
      so peculiarly French that perhaps only his countrymen can fully understand
      and appreciate it, and they have not been slow to do so.</p>
<p>All these characteristic traits appealed to them. His passion for equality,
      as strong as the Apostle Paul&rsquo;s, compelled him to take his followers
      into his confidence, to make them apprehend what he knew to the innermost
      thoughts of his heart. It forced him to exhibit the reasons for his
      faith to all who cared to know them, to arrange them in a logical order
      which would appeal to their understanding, and his passion of conviction
      assured him and them that what he taught was the very truth of God.
      Then he was a very great writer,<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> one
      of the founders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg
      156]</a></span> of modern French prose, the most exquisite literary
      medium that exists, a man made to arrest the attention of the people.
      He wrote all his important works in French for his countrymen, as well
      as in Latin for the learned world. His language and style were fresh,
      clear, and simple; without affected elegance or pedantic display of
      erudition; full of vigour and verve; here, caustic wit which attracted;
      there, eloquence which spoke to the hearts of his readers because it
      throbbed with burning passion and strong emotion.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that all his disciples in France appreciated his doctrinal
      system in its details. The <i>Christian Institution</i> appealed to
      them as the strongest protest yet made against the abuses and scandals
      of the Roman Church, as containing a code of duties owed to God and
      man, as exhibiting an ideal of life pure and lofty, as promising everlasting
      blessedness for the called and chosen and faithful. &ldquo;It satisfied at
      one and the same time the intellects which demanded logical proof and
      the souls which had need of enthusiasm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It has been remarked that Calvin&rsquo;s theology was less original and effective
      than his legislation or policy.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> The
      statement seems to overlook the peculiar service which was rendered
      to the Reformation movement by the <i>Institution</i>. The Reformation
      was a rebellion against the external authority of the medi&aelig;val
      Church; but every revolt, even that against the most flagrant abuses
      and the most corrupt rule, carries in it seeds of evil which must be
      slain if any real progress is to be made. For it instinctively tends
      to sweep away all restraints&mdash;those that are good and necessary
      as well as those that are bad and harmful. The leaders of every movement
      for reform have a harder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg
      157]</a></span> battle to fight against the revolutionaries in their
      following than against their avowed opponents. At the root of the Reformation
      of the sixteenth century lay an appeal from man to God&mdash;from the
      priest, granting or withholding absolution in the confessional, to
      God making the sinner, who turns from his sins and has faith in the
      person and work of Christ, know in his heart that he is pardoned; from
      the decision of Popes and Councils to the decrees of God revealed in
      His Holy Word. This appeal was in the nature of the case from the seen
      to the unseen, and therein lay the difficulty; for unless this unseen
      could be made visible to the eye of the intelligence to such a degree
      that the restraining authority which it possessed could impress itself
      on the will, there was risk of its proving to be no restraining authority
      whatsoever, and of men fancying that they had been left to be a law
      unto themselves. What the <i>Christian Institution</i> did for the
      sixteenth century was to make the unseen government and authority of
      God, to which all must bow, as visible to the intellectual eye of faith
      as the mechanism of the medi&aelig;val Church had been to the eye of
      sense. It proclaimed that the basis of all Christian faith was the
      Word of God revealed in the Holy Scriptures; it taught the absolute
      dependence of all things on God Himself immediately and directly; it
      declared that the sin of man was such that, apart from the working
      of the free grace of God, there could be neither pardon nor amendment,
      nor salvation; and it wove all these thoughts into a logical unity
      which revealed to the intellectual eye of its generation the &ldquo;House
      of God not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.&rdquo; Men as they gazed
      saw that they were in the immediate presence of the authority of God
      Himself, directly responsible to Him; that they could test &ldquo;the Pope&rsquo;s
      House&rdquo; by this divine archetype; that it was their duty to reform all
      human institutions, ecclesiastical or political, in order to bring
      them into harmony with the divine vision. It made men know that to
      separate themselves from the visible medi&aelig;val Church was neither
      to step outside the sphere of the purpose of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg
      158]</a></span> God making for their redemption, nor to free themselves
      from the duties which God requires of man.</p>
<p>The work which Calvin did for his co-religionists in France was immense.
      He carried on a constant correspondence with them; he sustained their
      courage; he gave their faith a sublime exaltation. When he heard of
      a French Romanist who had begun to hesitate, he wrote to him combining
      persuasion with instruction. He pleaded the cause of the Reformation
      with its nominal supporters. He encouraged the weak. He sent letters
      to the persecuted. He forwarded short theological treatises to assist
      those who had got into controversies concerning their faith. He advised
      the organisation of congregations. He recommended energetic pastors.
      He warned slothful ministers.</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;We must not think,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;that our work is confined within
            such narrow limits that our task is ended when we have preached
            sermons ... it is our part to maintain a vigilant oversight of
            those committed to our care, and take the greatest pains to guard
            from evil those whose blood will one day be demanded from us

<p>He answered question after question about the difficulty of reconciling
      the demands of the Christian life with what was required by the world
      around&mdash;a matter which pressed hard on the consciences of men
      and women who belonged to a religious minority in a great Roman Catholic
      kingdom. He was no casuist. He wrote to Madame de Cany, the sister
      of the Duchess d&rsquo;&Eacute;tampes, that &ldquo;no one, great or small, ought
      to believe themselves exempt from suffering for the sake of our sovereign
      King.&rdquo; He was listened to with reverence; for he was not a counsellor
      who advised others to do what he was not prepared to do himself. He
      could say, &ldquo;Be ye followers of me, as I am of the Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Frenchmen
      and Frenchwomen knew that the master whom they obeyed, the director
      they consulted, to whom they whispered the secrets of their souls,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg
      159]</a></span> lived the hardest and most ascetic life of any man
      in Europe,&mdash;scarcely eating, drinking, or sleeping; that his frail
      body was kept alive by the energy of his indomitable soul.</p>
<p>Frenchmen of varying schools of thought have not been slow to recognise
      the secret of the power of their great countryman. Jules Michelet says:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;Among the martyrs, with whom Calvin constantly conversed in spirit,
            he became a martyr himself; he lived and felt like a man before
            whom the whole earth disappears, and who tunes his last Psalm
            his whole eye fixed upon the eye of God, because he knows that
            on the following morning he may have to ascend the pyre.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ernest Renan is no less emphatic:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;It is surprising that a man who appears to us in his life and writings
            so unsympathetic should have been the centre of an immense movement
            in his generation, and that this harsh and severe tone should
            have exercised so great an influence on the minds of his contemporaries.
            How was it, for example, that one of the most distinguished women
            of her time, Ren&eacute;e of France, in her Court at Ferrara,
            surrounded by the flower of European wits, was captivated by
            that stern master, and by him drawn into a course that must have
            been so thickly strewn with thorns? This kind of austere seduction
            is exercised only by those who work with real conviction. Lacking
            that vivid, deep, sympathetic ardour which was one of the secrets
            of Luther&rsquo;s success, lacking the charm, the perilous, languishing
            tenderness of Francis de Sales, Calvin succeeded, in an age and
            in a country which called for a reaction towards Christianity,
            simply because <i>he was the most Christian man of his generation</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus it was that all those in France who felt the need of intimate fellowship
      with God, all to whom a religion, which was at once inflexible in matters
      of moral living and which appealed to their reasoning faculties, was
      a necessity, hailed the <i>Christian Institution</i> as the clearest
      manifesto of their faith, and grouped themselves round the young author
      (Calvin was barely twenty-six when he wrote it) as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg
      160]</a></span> their leader. Those also who suffered under the pressure
      of a despotic government, and felt the evils of a society constituted
      to uphold the privileges of an aristocracy, learnt that in a neighbouring
      country there was a city which had placed itself under the rule of
      the Word of God; where everyone joined in a common worship attractive
      from its severe simplicity; where the morals, public and private, were
      pure; where the believers selected their pastors and the people their
      rulers; where there were neither masters nor subjects; where the ministers
      of religion lived the lives of simple laymen, and were distinguished
      from them only by the exercise of their sacred service. They indulged
      in the dream that all France might be fashioned after the model of
      Geneva.</p>
<p>Many a Frenchman who was dissatisfied with the condition of things in
      France, but had come to no personal decision to leave the medi&aelig;val
      Church, could not help contrasting what he saw around him with the
      life and aspiration of those &ldquo;of the religion,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> as
      the French Protestants began to be called. They saw themselves confronted
      by a religion full of mysteries inaccessible to reason, expressing
      itself even in public worship in a language unintelligible to most
      of the worshippers, full of pomp, of luxury, of ceremonies whose symbolical
      meaning had been forgotten. They saw a clergy commonplace and ignorant,
      or aristocratic and indifferent; a nobility greedy and restless; a
      Court whose luxurious display and scandals were notorious; royal mistresses
      and faithless husbands and wives. Almost everywhere we find a growing
      tendency to contrast the purity of Protestantism and the corruption
      of Roman Catholicism. It found outcome in the famous scene in the <i>Parlement</i> of
      Paris (1559), when Antoine de Bourg, son of a former Chancellor, advocated
      the total suspension of the persecution against those
      &ldquo;who were called heretics,&rdquo; and enforced his opinion by contrasting
      the blasphemies and scandals of the Court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg
      161]</a></span> with the morality and the purity of the lives of those
      who were being sent to the stake,&mdash;a speech for which he afterwards
      lost his life.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>
<p>It was this growing united Protestantism which Henry <span class="smcap">II.</span> and
      his advisers had determined to crush by the action of the legislative
      authority.</p>
<h3>&sect; 5. <i>Persecution under Henry <span class="smcap">II.</span></i><a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></h3>
<p>The repressive legal measures introduced by Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span> were
      retained, and a new law against blasphemy (prepared, no doubt, during
      the last days of Francis) was published five days after the King&rsquo;s
      death (April 5th, 1547). But more was believed to be necessary. So
      a series of edicts, culminating in the Edict of Chateaubriand, were
      published, which aimed at uniting all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg
      162]</a></span> the forces of the kingdom to extirpate the Reformed
      faith.</p>
<p>On October 8th, 1547, a second criminal court was added to the <i>Parlement</i> of
      Paris, to deal solely with cases of heresy. This was the famous <i>Chambre
      Ardente</i>. It was ordered to sit continuously, even during the ordinary
      Parliamentary vacancies in August and September; and its first session
      lasted from Dec. 1547 to Jan. 1550, during which time it must have
      passed more than five hundred judgments. The clergy felt that this
      special court took from them one of their privileges, the right of
      trying all cases of heresy. They petitioned against it. A compromise
      was arranged (Edict of Nov. 19th, 1549), by which all cases of simple
      heresy (<i>cas communes</i>) were to be sent to the ecclesiastical
      courts, while cases of heresy accompanied by public scandal (<i>cas
      privil&eacute;gi&eacute;s</i>) were to be judged in the civil courts.
      In practice it usually happened that all cases of heresy went first
      before the ecclesiastical courts and, after judgment there, those which
      were believed to be attended by public scandal (the largest number)
      were sent on to the civil courts. These measures were not thought sufficient,
      and the Edict of Chateaubriand (June 27th, 1551) codified and extended
      all the various legal measures taken for the defence of the Roman Catholic
      faith.</p>
<p>The edict was lengthy, and began with a long preamble, which declared
      that in spite of all measures of repression, heresy was increasing;
      that it was a pestilence &ldquo;so contagious that it had infected most of
      the inhabitants, men, women, and even little children, in many of the
      towns and districts of the kingdom,&rdquo; and asked every loyal subject
      to aid the Government in extirpating the plague. It provided that,
      as before, all cases of simple heresy should be judged in the ecclesiastical
      courts, and that heresy accompanied with public scandal should be sent
      to the civil courts of the <i>Parlements</i>. It issued stringent regulations
      about the publication and sale of books; forbidding the introduction
      into France of volumes from Protestant countries; forbidding the printing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg
      163]</a></span> of books which had not passed the censor of the Faculty
      of Theology, and all books published anonymously; and ordering an examination
      of all printing houses and bookshops twice in the year. Private persons
      who did not inform against heretics were liable to be considered heretics
      themselves, and punished as such; and when they did denounce them they
      were to receive one-third of the possessions of the persons condemned.
      Parents were charged &ldquo;by the pity, love, and charity which they owed
      to their children,&rdquo; not to engage any teachers who might be &ldquo;suspect&rdquo;;
      no one was permitted to teach in school or college who was not certified
      to be orthodox; and masters were made responsible for their servants.
      Intercourse with those who had taken refuge in Geneva was prohibited,
      and the goods of the refugees were confiscated. All Catholics, and
      more especially persons of rank and in authority, were required to
      give the earnest example of attending carefully to outward observances
      of religion, and in particular to kneel in adoration of the Host.</p>
<p>The edict was registered on Sept. 3rd, 1551, and immediately put in force.
      Six years later, the King had to confess that its stringent provisions
      had failed to arrest the spread of the Protestant faith. He proposed
      to establish the Inquisition in France, moved thereto by the Cardinal
      of Lorraine and Pope Paul <span class="smcap">IV.</span>; and was prevented
      only by the strenuous opposition of his <i>Parlement</i>.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> He
      had to content himself with issuing the Edict of Compi&egrave;gne (1557),
      which, while nominally leaving trials for heresy in the hands of the
      ecclesiastical courts, practically handed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg
      164]</a></span> them over to the civil courts, where the judges were
      not allowed to inflict any lesser punishment than death. They were
      permitted to increase the penalty by inflicting torture, or to mitigate
      it by strangling the victims before burning them.</p>
<p>Armed with this legislation, the work of hunting out the Reformed was
      strenuously carried on. Certain prisons were specially reserved for
      the Protestant martyrs&mdash;the Conciergerie, which was part of the
      building of the Palace, and the Grand Ch&acirc;telet, which faced it
      on the opposite bank of the Seine. They soon overflowed, and suspects
      were confined in the Bastille, in the Petit Ch&acirc;telet, and in
      episcopal prisons. The cells of the Conciergerie were below the level
      of the river, and water oozed from the walls; the Grand Ch&acirc;telet
      was noted for its terrible dungeons, so small that the prisoner could
      neither stand upright nor lie at full length on the floor. Diseases
      decimated the victims; the plague slew sixty who were waiting for trial
      in the Grand Ch&acirc;telet in 1547. Few were acquitted; almost all,
      once arrested, suffered death and torture.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>
<h3>&sect; 6. <i>The Organisation of the French Protestant Church.</i></h3>
<p>It was during these years of terrible persecution that the Protestant
      Church of France organised itself&mdash;feeling the need for unity
      the better to sustain the conflict in which it was engaged, and to
      assist its weaker members. Calvin was unwearied in urging on this work
      of organisation. With the fire of a prophet and the foresight of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg
      165]</a></span> statesman he insisted on the necessity of unity during
      the storm and strain of a time of persecution. He had already shown
      what form the ecclesiastical organisation ought to take.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> He
      proposed to revive the simple threefold ministry of the Church of the
      early centuries&mdash;a congregation ruled by a bishop or pastor, a
      session of elders, and a body of deacons. This was adopted by the French
      Protestants. A group of believers, a minister, a &ldquo;consistory&rdquo; of elders
      and deacons, regular preaching, and the sacraments duly administered,
      made a Church properly constituted. The minister was the chief; he
      preached; he administered the sacraments; he presided at the &ldquo;consistory.&rdquo; The &ldquo;consistory&rdquo; was
      composed of elders charged with the spiritual oversight of the community,
      and of deacons who looked after the poor and the sick. The elders and
      the deacons were chosen by the members of the congregation; and the
      minister by the elders and the deacons. An organised Church did not
      come into existence all at once as a rule, and a distinction was drawn
      between an <i>&eacute;glise plant&eacute;e</i>, and an <i>&eacute;glise
      dress&eacute;e</i>. The former was in an embryonic state, with a pastor,
      it might be, but no consistory; or it might be only a group of people
      who welcomed the occasional services of a wandering missioner, or held
      simple services without any definite leader.</p>
<p>The year 1555 may be taken as the date when French Protestantism began
      to organise Churches. It is true that a few had been established earlier&mdash;at
      Meaux in 1546 and at Nimes in 1547, but the congregations had been
      dispersed by persecution. Before 1555 the Protestants of France had
      been for the most part solitary Bible students, or little companies
      meeting together for common worship without any organisation.</p>
<p>Paris set the example. A small company of believers had been accustomed
      to meet in the lodging of the Sieur de la Ferriere, near the Pr&eacute;-aux-Clercs.
      The birth of a child hastened matters. The father explained that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg
      166]</a></span> could not go outside France to seek a pure baptism,
      and that his conscience would not permit his child to be baptized according
      to the rites of the Roman Church. After prayer the company resolved
      to constitute themselves into a Church. Jean le Ma&ccedil;on was called
      to be the minister or pastor; elders and deacons were chosen; and the
      organisation was complete.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> It
      seemed as if all Protestant France had been waiting for the signal,
      and organised Churches sprang up everywhere.</p>
<p>Crespin names thirteen Churches, completely organised in the manner of
      the Church of Paris, founded between 1555 and 1557&mdash;Meaux, Poitiers,
      Angers, les Iles de Saintonge, Agen, Bourges, Issoudun, Aubigny, Blois,
      Tours, Lyon, Orl&eacute;ans, and Rouen. He adds that there were others.
      Documentary evidence now available enables us to give thirty-six more,
      all <i>dress&eacute;es</i>, or completely organised, with a consistory
      or kirk-session, before 1560. One hundred and twenty pastors were sent
      to France from Geneva before 1567. The history of these congregations
      during the reign of Henry <span class="smcap">II.</span> was full of
      tragic and dramatic incidents.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> They
      existed in the midst of a population which was for the most part fanatically
      Romanist, easily excited by priests and monks, who poured forth violent
      addresses from the pulpits of neighbouring churches. Law-courts, whether
      in the capital or in the provinces, the public officials, all loyal
      subjects of the King, were invited, commanded by the Edict of Chateaubriand,
      to ferret out and hunt down those suspected of Protestant sympathies.
      To fail to make a reverence when passing a crucifix, to speak unguardedly
      against an ecclesiastical ceremony, to exhibit the slightest sympathy
      for a Protestant martyr, to be found in possession of a book printed
      in Geneva, was sufficient to provoke a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg
      167]</a></span> denunciation, an arrest, a trial which must end in
      torture and death. Protestants were compelled to worship in cellars,
      to creep stealthily to their united devotions; like the early Christians
      during the persecutions under Decius or Diocletian, they had to meet
      at midnight; and these midnight assemblies gave rise to the same infamous
      reports about their character which the Jews spread abroad regarding
      the secret meetings of the Christians of the first three centuries.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> Every
      now and then they were discovered, as in the incident of the Rue Saint
      Jacques in Paris, and wholesale arrests and martyrdoms followed.</p>
<p>The organisation of the faithful into Churches had done much for French
      Protestantism in bestowing upon them the power which association gives;
      but more was needed to weld them into one. In 1558, doctrinal differences
      arose in the congregation at Poitiers. The Church in Paris was appealed
      to, and its minister, Antoine de Chandieu, went to Poitiers to assist
      at the celebration of the Holy Supper, and to heal the dispute. There,
      it is said, the idea of a Confession of Faith for the whole Church
      was suggested. Calvin was consulted, but did not approve. Notwithstanding,
      on May 25th, 1559, a number of ministers and elders, coming from all
      parts of France, and representing, according to a contemporary document
      whose authority is somewhat doubtful, sixty-six Churches,<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> met
      in Paris for conference. Three days were spent in deliberations, under
      the presidency of Morel, one of the Parisian ministers. This was the <i>First
      National Synod</i> of the French Protestant Church. It compiled a Confession
      of Faith and a Book of Discipline.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></p>
<p>The Confession of Faith<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> (<i>Confession
            de Foi faite d&rsquo;un commun accord par les Fran&ccedil;ois, qui
            desirent vivre selon la puret&eacute; de l&rsquo;&eacute;vangile de
            notre Seigneur J&eacute;sus Christ</i>) consists of forty articles.
            It was revised more than once by subsequent Synods, but may still
            be called the Confession of the French Protestant Church. It
            was based on a short Confession drafted by Calvin in 1557, and
            embodied in a letter to the King on behalf of his persecuted
            subjects. &ldquo;It seemed useful,&rdquo; one of the members of the Synod
            wrote to Calvin, &ldquo;to add some articles to your Confession, and
            to modify it slightly on some points.&rdquo;
      Probably out of deference to Calvin&rsquo;s objection to a creed for the
      whole Church, it was resolved to keep it secret for some time. The
      resolution was in vain. The Confession was in print, and known before
      the end of 1559.</p>
<p>The Book of Discipline (<i>Discipline eccl&eacute;siastique des
      &eacute;glises r&eacute;form&eacute;es de France</i>) regulated the
      organisation and the discipline of the Churches. It was that kind of
      ecclesiastical polity which has become known as Presbyterian, but which
      might be better called Conciliar. A council called the <i>Consistory</i>,
      consisting of the minister or ministers, elders, and deacons, ruled
      the congregation. Congregations were formed into groups, over which
      was the <i>Colloquy</i>, composed of representatives from the Consistories;
      over the <i>Colloquies</i> were the <i>Provincial Synods</i>; and over
      all the <i>General</i> or <i>National Synod</i>. Rules were laid down
      about how discipline was to be exercised. It was stated clearly that
      no Church could claim a primacy over the others. All ministers were
      required to sign the Confession of Faith, and to acknowledge and submit
      to the ecclesiastical discipline.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></p>
<p>It is interesting to see how in a country whose civil rule was becoming
      gradually more absolutist, this &ldquo;Church under the Cross&rdquo; framed for
      itself a government which reconciled, more thoroughly perhaps than
      has ever been done since, the two principles of popular rights and
      supreme central control. Its constitution has spread to Holland, Scotland,
      and to the great American Churches. Their ecclesiastical polity came
      much more from Paris than from Geneva.</p>
<h3>&sect; 7. <i>Reaction against Persecution.</i></h3>
<p>An attentive study of the sources of the history of the period shows that
      the excessive severity of King and Court towards Protestants had excited
      a fairly widespread reaction in favour of the persecuted, and had also
      impelled the King to action which was felt by many to be unconstitutional.
      This sympathy with the persecuted and repugnance to the arbitrary exercise
      of kingship did much to mould the Huguenot movement which lay in the
      immediate future.</p>
<p>The protests against the institution of the <i>Chambre Ardente</i>, the
      refusal of the <i>Parlement</i> of Paris to register the edict establishing
      the Inquisition in France, and the hesitancy to put in execution extraordinary
      powers bestowed on French Cardinals for the punishing of heretics by
      the Bull of Pope Paul <span class="smcap">IV.</span> (Feb. 26th, 1557),
      may all be ascribed to the jealousy with which the Courts, ecclesiastical
      and civil, viewed any interference with their privileged jurisdiction.
      But the Edict of Chateaubriand (1551), with its articles declaring
      the unwillingness or negligence shown by public officials in finding
      out and punishing heretics, making provisions against this, and ordaining
      that none but persons of well-known orthodoxy were to be appointed
      magistrates (Arts. 23, 28, 24), confessed that there were many even
      among those in office who disliked the policy of persecution.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg
      170]</a></span> Contemporary official documents confirm this unwillingness.
      We hear of municipal magistrates intervening to protect their Protestant
      fellow-citizens from punishment in the ecclesiastical courts; of town&rsquo;s
      police conniving at the escape of heretics; of a procurator at law
      who was suspended from office for a year for such connivance;<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> and
      of civil courts who could not be persuaded to pass sentences except
      merely nominal ones.</p>
<p>The growing discontent at the severe treatment of the persecuted Protestants
      made itself manifest, even within the <i>Parlement</i> of Paris, so
      long notorious for its persecuting zeal. This became evident when the
      criminal court of the <i>Parlement</i> (la Tournelle, 1559) commuted
      a sentence of death passed on three Protestants into one of banishment.
      The violent Romanists protested against this, and demanded a meeting
      of the whole <i>Parlement</i> to fix its mode of judicial action. At
      this meeting some of the members&mdash;Antoine Fum&eacute;e, du Faur,
      Viole, and Antoine du Bourg (the son of a Chancellor in the days of
      Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span>)&mdash;spoke strongly on behalf
      of the Protestants. They pleaded that a space of six months after trial
      should be given to the accused to reconsider their position, and that,
      if they resolve to stand fast in the faith, they should be allowed
      to withdraw from the kingdom. Their boldness encouraged others. The
      Cardinal Lorraine and the Constable Montmorency dreaded the consequences
      of prolonged discussion, and communicated their fears to the King.
      Henry, accompanied by the Cardinals of Lorraine and of Guise, the Constable,
      and Francis, Duke de Guise, entered the hall where <i>Parlement</i> sat,
      and ordered the discussion to be continued in his presence. The minority
      were not intimidated. Du Faur and Viole demanded a total cessation
      of the persecution pending the summoning of a Council. Du Bourg went
      further. He contrasted the pure lives and earnest piety of the persecuted
      with the scandals which disgraced the Roman Church and the Court.
      &ldquo;It is no light matter,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to condemn to the stake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg
      171]</a></span> men who invoke the name of Jesus in the midst of the
      flames.&rdquo; The King was furious. He ordered the arrest of du Bourg and
      du Faur on the spot, and shortly afterwards Fum&eacute;e and La Porte
      were also sent to the Bastille. This arbitrary seizure of members of
      the <i>Parlement</i> of Paris may be said to mark the time when the
      Protestants of France began to assume the form of a political as well
      as of a religious party. At this anxious juncture Henry <span class="smcap">II.</span> met
      his death, on June 30th, by the accidental thrust of a lance at a tournament
      held in honour of the approaching marriage of his daughter Elizabeth
      with Philip of Spain. He lingered till July 10th, 1559.</p>
<h3>&sect; 8. <i>The higher Aristocracy won for the Reformation.</i></h3>
<p>When the lists of Protestants who suffered for their faith in France or
      who were compelled to take refuge in Geneva and other Protestant towns
      are examined and analysed, as they have been by French arch&aelig;ologists,
      it is found that the great number of martyrs and refugees were artisans,
      tradesmen, farmers, and the like.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> A
      few names of &ldquo;notables&rdquo;&mdash;a general, a member of the <i>Parlement</i> of
      Toulouse, a &ldquo;gentleman&rdquo; of Limousin&mdash;are found among the martyrs,
      and a much larger proportion among the fugitives. The names of members
      of noble houses of France are conspicuous by their absence. This does
      not necessarily mean that the new teaching had not found acceptance
      among men and women in the upper classes of French society. The noble
      of the sixteenth century, so long as he remained within his own territory
      and in his ch&acirc;teau, was almost independent. He was not subject
      to the provincial tribunals. Protestantism had been spreading among
      such. We hear of several high-born ladies present in the congregation
      of three or four hundred Protestants who were surrounded in a large
      house in the Rue St. Jacques (Sept. 4th, 1558), and who were released.
      Ren&eacute;e,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg

      Duchess of Ferrara, had declared herself a Protestant, and had been
      visited by Calvin as early as 1535.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> Francis
      d&rsquo;Andelot, the youngest of the three Chatillons, became a convert during
      his imprisonment at Melun (1551-56). His more celebrated brother, Gaspard
      de Coligny, the Admiral of France, became a Protestant during his imprisonment
      after the fall of St. Quentin (1558).<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> De
      B&egrave;ze (Beza) tells us that as early as 1555, Antoine de Bourbon,
      titular King of Navarre in right of his wife Jeanne d&rsquo;Albret, and next
      in succession to King Henri <span class="smcap">II.</span> and his
      sons, had the new faith preached in the chapel at N&eacute;rac, and
      that he asked a minister to be sent to him from Geneva. His brother
      Louis, Prince of Cond&eacute;, also declared himself on the Protestant
      side. The wives of the brothers Bourbon, Jeanne d&rsquo;Albret and El&eacute;anor
      de Roye, were more determined and consistent Protestants than their
      husbands. The two brothers were among those present at the assemblies
      in the Pr&eacute;-aux-Clercs, where for five successive evenings (May
      13-17) more than five thousand persons met to sing Clement Marot&rsquo;s
      Psalms.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> Calvin
      wrote energetically to all these great nobles, urging them to declare
      openly on the side of the Gospel, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg

      themselves.</p>
<h3>&sect; 9. <i>France ruled by the Guises.</i><a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></h3>
<p>The successor of Henry <span class="smcap">II.</span> was his son Francis <span class="smcap">II.</span>,
      who was fifteen years of age, and therefore entitled by French law
      to rule in his own name. He was a youth feeble in mind and in body,
      and devotedly attached to his young and accomplished wife, Mary Queen
      of Scots. She believed naturally that her husband could not do better
      than entrust the government of the kingdom to her uncles, Charles the
      Cardinal of Lorraine, and Francis the Duke de Guise. The Cardinal had
      been Henry <span class="smcap">II.</span>&rsquo;s most trusted Minister;
      and his brother was esteemed to be the best soldier in France. When
      the <i>Parlement</i> of Paris, according to ancient custom, came to
      congratulate the King on his succession, and to ask to whom they were
      to apply in affairs of State, they were told by the King that they
      were to obey the Cardinal and the Duke &ldquo;as himself.&rdquo; The Constable
      de Montmorency and the favourite, Diane de Poitiers, were sent from
      the Court, and the Queen-Mother, Catherine de&rsquo; Medici, that &ldquo;shopkeeper&rsquo;s
      daughter,&rdquo; as the young Queen called her, found herself as devoid of
      influence as she had been during the lifetime of her husband.</p>
<p>The Cardinal of Lorraine had been the chief adviser of that policy of
      extirpating the Protestants to which the late King had devoted himself,
      and it was soon apparent that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg
      174]</a></span> it would be continued by the new government. The process
      against Antoine du Bourg and his fellow-members of the <i>Parlement</i> of
      Paris who had dared to remonstrate against the persecution, was pushed
      forward with all speed. They were condemned to the stake, and the only
      mitigation of sentence was that Du Bourg was to be strangled before
      he was burnt. His fate provoked much sympathy. As he was led to the
      place of execution the crowd pleaded with him to recant. His resolute,
      dignified bearing made a great impression; and his dying speech, according
      to one eye-witness, &ldquo;did more harm to the Roman Church than a hundred
      ministers could have done,&rdquo; and, according to another, &ldquo;made more converts
      among the French students than all the books of Calvin.&rdquo; The persecutions
      of Protestants of lower rank increased rather than diminished. Police
      made descents on the houses in the Rue de Marais-Saint-Germain and
      neighbouring streets.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> Spies
      were hired to insinuate themselves into the confidence of the suspected
      for the purpose of denouncing them. The <i>Parlement</i> of Paris instituted
      four separate criminal courts for the sole purpose of trying heretics
      brought before them. The prisons were no sooner filled than they were
      emptied by sentences which sent the condemned to the galleys or to
      death. The government incited to persecution by new declarations and
      edicts. It declared that houses in which conventicles were held were
      to be razed to the ground (Sept. 4th, 1559); that all who organised
      unlawful assemblies were to be punished by death (Nov. 9th, 1559);
      that nobles who had justiciary courts were to act according to law
      in the matter of heresy, or to be deprived of their justiciary rights
      (Feb. 1560). In spite of all this stern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg
      175]</a></span> repression, the numbers of the Protestants increased,
      and Calvin could declare that there were at least 300,000 in France.</p>
<p>The character of Protestantism in France had been changing. In the earlier
      years of the persecution they had submitted meekly without thought
      of revolt, resigned to their fate, rejoicing to suffer in the cause
      of Christ. But under this rule of the Guises the question of resistance
      was discussed. It could be said that revolt did not mean revenge for
      injuries done to themselves. A foreign family had overawed their King
      and imposed themselves on France. The Princes of the Blood, Antoine
      de Bourbon and his brother Louis de Cond&eacute;, in whose veins ran
      the blood of Saint Louis, who were the natural leaders of the people,
      were flouted by the Guises. The inviolability of <i>Parlement</i> had
      been attacked in the execution of Antoine du Bourg, and the justiciary
      rights of great nobles were threatened simply in order to extirpate &ldquo;those
      of the religion.&rdquo; They believed that France was full of men who had
      no good will to the tyranny of the &ldquo;foreigners.&rdquo;
      They consulted their brethren in exile, and Calvin himself, on the
      lawfulness and expediency of an armed insurrection. The refugees favoured
      the plan. Calvin denounced it.
      &ldquo;If one drop of blood is shed in such a revolt, rivers will flow; it
      is better that we all perish than cause such a scandal to the cause
      of Christ and His Evangel.&rdquo; Some of the Protestants were not to be
      convinced. They only needed a leader. Their natural head was the King
      of Navarre; but Antoine de Bourbon was too unstable. Louis de Cond&eacute;,
      his brother, was sounded.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> It
      is said that he promised to come forward if the enterprise was confined
      to the seizure of the Guises, and if it was successful in effecting
      this. A Protestant gentleman, Godefroy de Barry, Seigneur de la Renaudie,
      became temporary leader.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg
      176]</a></span> He had wrongs to avenge. He had been condemned by the <i>Parlement</i> of
      Dijon (Burgundy), had escaped to Geneva, and had been converted there;
      his brother-in-law, Gaspard de Heu, of Metz, had been strangled by
      the Guises in the castle of Vincennes without form of trial. A number
      of gentlemen and nobles promised their assistance. The conspirators
      swore to undertake nothing against the King; the enterprise was limited
      to the arrest of the Guises. News of the project began to leak out.
      Every information went to show that the Guises were the objects of
      attack. The Court was moved from Blois to Amboise, which was a fortified
      city. More precise information filtered to headquarters. The Duke of
      Guise captured some small bands of conspirators, and de la Renaudie
      himself was slain in a skirmish. The Guises took summary vengeance.
      Their prisoners were often slaughtered when caught; or were tied hand
      and foot and thrown into the Loire. Others were hurried through a form
      of trial. So many gallows were needed that there was not wood enough,
      and the prisoners were hung from the doors and battlements of the castle
      of Amboise. The young King and Queen, with their ladies, walked out
      after dinner to feast their eyes on the dead bodies.</p>
<p>Even before the Conspiracy of Amboise had run its length, members of the
      Court had begun to protest against the religious policy of the Guises.
      Catherine de&rsquo; Medici had talked the matter over with the Admiral Coligny,
      had been told by him that the religious persecutions were at the bottom
      of the troubles in the kingdom, and had listened to his proposal that
      all such should be suspended until the meeting of a Council. The result
      was that government decided to pardon those accused of heresy if they
      would promise for the future to live as good Catholics. The brutalities
      of the methods by which the sharers in the foolishly planned and feebly
      executed Conspiracy of Amboise were punished increased the state of
      disorder in the kingdom, and the hatred against the Guises found vent
      in an <i>Epistle sent to the Tiger of France</i>, in which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg
      177]</a></span> Duke is addressed as a &ldquo;mad tiger, a venomous viper,
      a sepulchre of abominations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine de&rsquo; Medici deemed the opportunity favourable for exercising
      her influence. She contrived to get Michel de l&rsquo;H&ocirc;pital appointed
      as Chancellor, knowing that he was opposed to the sanguinary policy
      pursued. He was able to inspire the Edict of Romorantin (May 18th,
      1560), which made the Bishops judges of the crime of heresy, imposed
      penalties on false accusers, and left the punishment to be bestowed
      on attendance at conventicles in the hands of the presidents of the
      tribunals. Then, with the help of the Chancellor, Catherine managed
      to get an <i>Assembly of the Notables</i> summoned to meet at Fontainebleau.
      There, many of the members advocated a cessation of the religious persecution.
      One Archbishop, Marillac of Vienne, and the Bishops of Orl&eacute;ans
      and Valence, asserted boldly that the religious disorders were really
      caused by the scandals in the Church; spoke against severe repression
      until a Council, national or general, had been held; and hinted that
      the services of the Guises were not indispensable. At the beginning
      of the second session Coligny spoke. He had the courage to make himself
      the representative of the Huguenots, as the Protestants now began to
      be nicknamed. He attacked boldly the religious policy of the Guises,
      charged them with standing between the King and loyal subjects, and
      declared that the persecuted were Christians who asked for nothing
      but to be allowed to worship God as the Gospel taught them. He presented
      a petition to the King from the Protestants asserting their loyalty,
      begging that the persecution should cease, and asking that &ldquo;temples&rdquo; might
      be assigned for their worship. The petition was unsigned, but Coligny
      declared that fifty thousand names could be obtained in Normandy alone.
      The Duke of Guise spoke with great violence, but the more politic Cardinal
      induced him to agree with the other members to call a meeting of the
      States General of France, to be held on the 10th of December 1560.</p>
<p>Shortly after the Notables had dispersed, word came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg
                  178]</a></span> of another conspiracy, in which not only
                  the Bourbon Princes, but also the Constable Montmorency
                  were said to be implicated. Disturbances broke out in Provence
                  and Dauphin&eacute;. The Guises went back to their old
                  policy of violence. The King of Navarre and the Prince
                  of Cond&eacute; were summoned by the King to appear before
                  him to justify themselves. Although well warned of what
                  might happen, they obeyed the summons, and presented themselves
                  unattended by armed men. Cond&eacute; was seized and imprisoned.
                  He was condemned to death, and his execution was fixed
                  for the 10th of December. The King of Navarre was left
                  at liberty, but was closely watched; and more than one
                  attempt was made to assassinate him. It was vaguely believed
                  that the Cardinal of Lorraine had resolved to get rid of
                  all the leaders of the Huguenots by death or imprisonment.</p>
<p>While these terrifying suggestions were being whispered, the young King
      fell ill, and died suddenly. This ended the rule of the Guises, and
      the French Protestants breathed freely again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever read or hear,&rdquo; said Calvin in a letter to Sturm, &ldquo;of anything
      more opportune than the death of the King? The evils had reached an
      extremity for which there was no remedy, when suddenly God shows Himself
      from heaven. He who pierced the eye of the father has now stricken
      the ear of the son.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>&sect; 10. <i>Catherine de&rsquo; Medici becomes Regent.</i></h3>
<p>In the confusion which resulted, Catherine recognised that at last the
      time had come when she could gratify the one strong passion which possessed
      her&mdash;the passion to govern. Charles <span class="smcap">IX.</span> was
      a boy of ten. A Regent was essential. Antoine de Bourbon, as the first
      Prince of the Blood, might have claimed the position; but Catherine
      first terrified him with what might be the fate of Cond&eacute;, and
      then proposed that the Constable Montmorency and himself should be
      her principal advisers. The facile Antoine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg
      179]</a></span> accepted the situation: the Constable was recalled
      to the Court; Louis de Cond&eacute; was released from prison. His imprisonment
      had made a deep impression all over France. The Protestants believed
      that he had suffered for their sakes. Hymns of prayer had been sung
      during his captivity, and songs of thanksgiving greeted his release.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>Catherine de&rsquo; Medici was forty-one years of age when she became the Regent
      of France.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> Her
      life had been hard. Born in 1519, the niece of Pope Clement VII, she
      was married to Henry of France in 1534. She had been a neglected wife
      all the days of her married life. For ten years she had been childless,<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> and
      her sonnets breathe the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg
      180]</a></span> prayer of Rachel&mdash;Give me children, or else I
      die. During Henry&rsquo;s absence with the army in 1552, he had grudgingly
      appointed her Regent, and she had shown both ability and patience in
      acquiring a knowledge of all the details of government. After the defeat
      of Saint-Quentin she for once earned her husband&rsquo;s gratitude and praise
      by the way in which she had promptly persuaded the Parliament to grant
      a subsidy of 300,000 livres. These incidents were her sole apprenticeship
      in the art of ruling. She had always been a great eater, walker, and
      rider.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> Her
      protruding eyes and her bulging forehead recalled the features of her
      grand-uncle, Pope Leo <span class="smcap">X.</span> She had the taste
      of her family for art and display. Her strongest intellectual force
      was a robust, hard, and narrow common sense which was responsible both
      for her success and for her failures. She can scarcely be called immoral;
      it seemed rather that she was utterly destitute of any moral sense
      whatsoever.</p>
<p>The difficulties which confronted the Regent were great, both at home
      and abroad. The question of questions was the treatment to be given
      to her Protestant subjects. She seems from the first to have been in
      favour of a measure of toleration; but the fanatically Roman Catholic
      party was vigorous in France, especially in Paris, and was ably led
      by the Guises; and Philip of Spain had made the suppression of the
      Reformation a matter of international policy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Catherine had to face the States General, summoned by the late
      King in August 1560. While the Guises were still in power, strict orders
      had been given to see that none but ardent Romanists should be elected;
      but the excitement of the times could not be restrained by any management.
      It was nearly half a century since a King of France had invited a declaration
      of the opinions of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg
      181]</a></span> subjects; the last meeting of the States General had
      been in 1484.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> Catherine
      watched the elections, and the expression of sentiments which they
      called forth. She saw that the Protestants were active. Calvinist ministers
      traversed the West and the South almost unhindered, encouraging the
      people to assert their liberties. They were even permitted to address
      some of the assemblies met to elect representatives. A minister, Charles
      Dalbiac, expounded the Confession of Faith to the meeting of the nobles
      at Angers, and showed how the Roman Church had enslaved and changed
      the whole of the Christian faith and practice. In other places it was
      said that Antoine de Bourbon had no right to allow Catherine to assume
      the Regency, and that he ought to be forced to take his proper place.
      The air seemed full of menaces against the Regent and in favour of
      the Princes of the Blood. Catherine hastened to place the King of Navarre
      in a position of greater dignity. She shared the Regency nominally
      with the premier Prince of the Blood, who was Lieutenant-General of
      France. If Antoine had been a man of resolution, he might have insisted
      on a large share in the government of the country, but his easy, careless
      disposition made him plastic in the hands of Catherine, and she could
      write to her daughter that he was very obedient, and issued no order
      without her permission.</p>
<p>The Estates met at Orl&eacute;ans on the 13th of December. The opening
      speech by the Chancellor, Michel de l&rsquo;H&ocirc;pital, showed that the
      Regent and her councillors were at least inclined to a policy of tolerance.
      The three orders (Clergy, Nobles, and Third Estate), he said, had been
      summoned to find remedies for the divisions which existed within the
      kingdom; and these, he believed, were due to religion. He could not
      help recognising that religious beliefs, good or bad, tended to excite
      burning passions. He could not avoid seeing that a common religion
      was a stricter bond of unity than belonging to the same race or living
      under the same laws. Might they not all wait for the decision of a
      General Council? Might they not cease to use the irritating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg
      182]</a></span> epithets of <i>Lutherans</i>, <i>Huguenots</i>, <i>Papists</i>,
      and remember that they were all good Christians. The spokesmen of the
      three orders were heard at the second sitting. Dr. Quintin, one of
      the Regents of the University of Paris, voiced the Clergy. He enlarged
      against the proposals which were to be brought forward by the other
      two orders to despoil the revenues of the Church, to attempt its reform
      by the civil power, and to grant toleration and even liberty of worship
      to heretics. Coligny begged the Regent to note that Quintin had called
      subjects of the King heretics, and the spokesman of the Clergy apologised.
      Jacques de Silly, Baron de Rochefort, and Jean Lange, an advocate of
      Bordeaux, who spoke for the Nobles and for the Third Estate, declaimed
      against the abuses of ecclesiastical courts, and the avarice and ignorance
      of the clergy.</p>
<p>At the sitting on Jan. 1st, 1561, each of the three Estates presented
      a written list of grievances (<i>cahiers</i>). That of the Third Estate
      was a memorable and important document in three hundred and fifty-four
      articles, and reveals, as no other paper of the time does, the evils
      resulting from absolutist and aristocratic government in France. It
      asked for complete toleration in matters of religion, for a Reformation
      of the Church in the sense of giving a large extension of power to
      the laity, for uniformity in judicial procedure, for the abolition
      or curtailment of powers in signorial courts, for quinquennial meetings
      of the Estates General, and demanded that the day and place of the
      next meeting should be fixed before the end of the present sitting.
      The Nobles were divided on the question of toleration, and presented
      three separate papers. In the first, which came from central Prance,
      stern repression of the Protestant faith was demanded; in the second,
      coming from the nobles of the Western provinces, complete toleration
      was claimed; in the third it was asked that both parties should be
      made to keep the peace, and that only preachers and pastors be punished.
      The list presented by the Clergy, like those of the other two orders,
      insisted upon the reform of the Church; but it took the line of urging
      the abolition of the Concordat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg
      183]</a></span> and a return to the provisions of the Pragmatic Sanction
      of Bourges.</p>
<p>The Government answered these lists of grievances presented by an edict
      and an ordinance. In the edict (Jan. 28th, 1561) the King ordered that
      all prosecutions for religion should cease, and that all prisoners
      should be released, with an admonition &ldquo;to live in a catholic manner&rdquo;
      for the future. The ordinance (dated Jan. 31st, but not completed till
      the following August), known as the <i>Ordinance of Orl&eacute;ans</i>,
      was a very elaborate document. It touched upon almost all questions
      brought forward in the lists of grievances, and enacted various reforms,
      both civil and ecclesiastic&mdash;all of which were for the most part
      evaded in practice. The Estates were adjourned until the 1st of May.</p>
<p>The Huguenots had gained a suspension of persecution, if not toleration,
      by the edict of Jan. 28th, and the disposition of the Government made
      them hope for still further assistance. Refugees came back in great
      numbers from Switzerland, Germany, England, and even from Italy. The
      number of Protestant congregations increased, and Geneva provided the
      pastors. The edict did not give liberty of worship, but the Protestants
      acted as if it did. This roused the wrath of the more fanatically disposed
      portion of the Roman Catholic population. Priests and monks fanned
      the flames of sectarian bitterness. The Government was denounced, and
      anti-Protestant riots disturbed the country. When the Huguenots of
      Paris attempted to revive the psalm-singings in the Pr&eacute;-aux-Clercs,
      they were mobbed, and beaten with sticks by the populace. This led
      to reprisals in those parts of the country where the Huguenots were
      in a majority. In some towns the churches were invaded, the images
      torn down, and the relics burnt. The leaders strove to restrain their
      followers.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> Calvin
      wrote energetically from Geneva against the lawlessness:</p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;God has never enjoined on any one to destroy idols, save on every
            man in his own house or on those placed in authority in public
            places.... Obedience is better than sacrifice; we must look to
            what it is lawful for us to do, and must keep ourselves within
            bounds.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the Court at Fontainebleau, Ren&eacute;e, Duchess of Ferrara, and the
      Princess of Cond&eacute; were permitted by the Regent to have worship
      in their rooms after the Reformed rite; and Coligny had in his household
      a minister from Geneva, Jean Raymond Merlin, to whose sermons outsiders
      were not only admitted but invited. These things gave great offence
      to the Constable Montmorency, who was a strong Romanist. He was still
      more displeased when Monluc, Bishop of Valence, preached in the State
      apartments before the boy King and the Queen Mother. He thought it
      was undignified for a Bishop to preach, and he believed that Monluc&rsquo;s
      sermons contained something very like Lutheran theology. He invited
      the Duke of Guise and Saint-Andr&eacute;, both old enemies, to supper
      (April 16th, 1561), and the three pleged themselves to save the Romanism
      of France. This union was afterwards known as the Triumvirate.</p>
<p>Meanwhile religious disturbances were increasing. The Huguenots demanded
      the right to have &ldquo;temples&rdquo;
      granted to them or built at their own expense; and in many places they
      openly gathered for public worship and for the celebration of the Lord&rsquo;s
      Supper. They frequently met armed to protect themselves from attack.
      The Government at length interfered, and by an edict (July 1561) prohibited,
      under penalty of confiscation of property, all conventicles, public
      or private, whether the worshippers were armed or unarmed, where sermons
      were made and the sacraments celebrated in any other fashion than that
      of the Catholic Church. The edict declared, on the other hand, that
      magistrates were not to be too zealous; persons who laid false information
      were to be severely punished; and all attacks on houses were forbidden.
      It was evidently meant to conciliate both parties. Coligny did not
      discontinue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg
      185]</a></span> the services in his apartments, and wrote to his co-religionists
      that they had nothing to fear so long as they worshipped in private
      houses. Jeanne d&rsquo;Albret declared herself openly a Protestant; and as
      she travelled from N&eacute;rac to Fontainebleau she restored to the
      Huguenots churches which the magistrates had taken from them in obedience
      to the edict of July.</p>
<p>The prorogued meeting of the States General did not assemble until the
      1st of August, and even then representatives of two orders only were
      present. An ecclesiastical synod was sitting at Poissy (opened July
      28th), and the clerical representatives were there. It was the 27th
      of August before the three orders met together in presence of the King
      and the members of his Council at Saint-Germain. The meeting had been
      called for the purpose of discussing the question of national finance;
      but it was impossible to ignore the religious question.</p>
<p>In their <i>cahiers</i>, both the Nobles and the Third Estate advocated
      complete toleration and the summoning a National Council. The financial
      proposals of the Third Estate were thoroughgoing. After a statement
      of the national indebtedness, and a representation that taxation had
      reached its utmost limits, they proposed that money should be obtained
      from the superfluity of ecclesiastical wealth. In their <i>cahier</i> of
      Jan. 1st, the Third Estate had sketched a civil constitution for the
      French Church; they now went further, and proposed that all ecclesiastical
      revenues should be nationalised, and that the clergy should be paid
      by the State. They calculated that a surplus of seventy-two million
      livres would result, and proposed that forty-two millions should be
      set aside to liquidate the national debt.</p>
<p>This bold proposal was impracticable in the condition of the kingdom.
      The <i>Parlement</i> of Paris regarded it as a revolutionary attack
      on the rights of property, and it alienated them for ever from the
      Reformation movement; but it enabled the Government to wring from the
      alarmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span> Churchmen
      a subsidy of sixteen million livres, to be paid in six annual instalments.</p>
<h3>&sect; 11. <i>The Conference at Poissy.</i></h3>
<p>It was scarcely possible, in view of the Pope and Philip of Spain, to
      assemble a National Council, but the Government had already conceived
      the idea of a meeting of theologians, which would be such an assembly
      in all but the name. They had invited representatives of the Protestant
      ministers (July 25th) to attend the synod of the clergy sitting at
      Poissy. The invitation had been accepted, and the Government intended
      to give an air of unusual solemnity to the meeting. The King, surrounded
      by his mother, his brothers, and the Princes of the Blood, presided
      as at a sitting of the States General. The Chancellor, in the King&rsquo;s
      name, opened the session with a remarkable speech, in which he set
      forth the advantages to be gained from religious union. He addressed
      the assembled bishops and Roman Catholic theologians, assuring them
      that they ought to have no scruples in meeting the Protestant divines.
      The latter were not heretics like the old Manicheans or Arians. They
      accepted the Scriptures as the Rule of Faith, the Apostles&rsquo; Creed,
      the four principal Councils and <i>their</i> Creeds (the symbols of
      Nicea, Constantinople, and Chalcedon). The main difference between
      them was that the Protestants wished the Church to be reformed according
      to the primitive pattern. They had given proof of their sincerity by
      being content to die for their faith.</p>
<p>The Reformers were represented by twelve ministers, among whom were Morel
      of Paris; Nicolas des Gallars, minister of the French Protestant Church
      in London, and by twenty laymen. Their leader was Th&eacute;odore de
      B&egrave;ze (Beza), a man of noble birth, celebrated as a Humanist,
      a brilliant writer and controversialist, whom Calvin, at the request
      of Antoine de Bourbon, Catherine de&rsquo; Medici, and Coligny, had commissioned
      to represent him. De B&egrave;ze<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg
      187]</a></span> was privately presented to the King and the Regent
      by the King of Navarre and by the Prince de Cond&eacute;, and his learning,
      presence, and stately courtesy made a great impression upon the Court.
      He had been born in the same year as the Regent (1519), and had thrown
      away very brilliant prospects to become a minister of the Reformed
      Church.</p>
<p>The meeting was held in the refectory of the nuns of Poissy.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> The
      King and his suite were placed at one end of the hall, and the Romanist
      bishops and theologians were arranged by the walls on the two sides.
      After the Chancellor had finished his speech, the representatives of
      the Protestants were introduced by the Duke of Guise, in command of
      an escort of the King&rsquo;s archers. They were placed in front of a barrier
      which separated them from the Romanist divines. &ldquo;There come the dogs
      of Geneva,&rdquo;
      said the Cardinal of Tournon as they entered the hall.</p>
<p>The speech of de B&egrave;ze, delivered on the first day (Sept. 7th) of
      the Colloquy, as it came to be called, made a great impression. He
      expounded with clearness of thought and precision of language the creed
      of his Church, showing where it agreed and where it differed from that
      of the Roman Catholic. The gravity and the charm of his eloquence compelled
      attention, and it was not until he began to criticise with frank severity
      the doctrine of transubstantiation that he provoked murmurs of dissent.
      The speech must have disappointed Catherine. It had made no attempt
      to attenuate the differences between the two confessions, and held
      out no hopes of a reunion of the Churches.</p>
<p>The Cardinal of Lorraine was charged to reply on behalf of the Roman Catholic
      party (Sept. 16th). His speech was that of a strong partisan, and dealt
      principally with the two points of the authority of the Church in matters
      of faith and usage, and the doctrine of the Sacrament of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg
      188]</a></span> the Holy Supper. There was no attempt at conciliation.</p>
<p>Three days after (Sept. 19th), Cardinal Ippolito d&rsquo;Este arrived at Saint-Germain,
      accompanied by a numerous suite, among whom was Laynez, the General
      of the Society of Jesus. He had been sent by the Pope, legate <i>a
      latere</i>, to end, if possible, the conference at Poissy, and to secure
      the goodwill of the French Government for the promulgation of the decrees
      of the Council of Trent. He so far prevailed that the last two sittings
      of the conference (Sept. 24th, 26th) were with closed doors, and were
      scenes of perpetual recriminations. Laynez distinguished himself by
      his vituperative violence. The Protestant ministers were &ldquo;wolves,&rdquo;
      &ldquo;foxes,&rdquo; &ldquo;serpents,&rdquo; &ldquo;assassins.&rdquo; Catherine persevered. She arranged
      a conference between five of the more liberal Roman Catholic clergy
      and five Protestant ministers. It met (Sept. 30th, Oct. 1st), and managed
      to draft a formula about the Holy Supper which was at once rejected
      by the Bishops of the French Church (Oct. 9th).</p>
<p>Out of this Colloquy of Poissy came the edict of January 17th, 1562, which
      provided that Protestants were to surrender all the churches and ecclesiastical
      buildings they had seized, and prohibited them from meeting for public
      worship, whether within a building or not, inside the walls of any
      town. On the other hand, they were to have the right to assemble for
      public worship anywhere outside walled towns, and meetings in private
      houses within the walls were not prohibited. Thus the Protestants of
      France secured legal recognition for the first time, and enjoyed the
      right to worship according to their conscience. They were not satisfied&mdash;they
      could scarcely be, so long as they were kept outside the walls; but
      their leaders insisted on their accepting the edict as a reasonable
      compromise. &ldquo;If the liberty promised us in the edict lasts,&rdquo; Calvin
      wrote, &ldquo;the Papacy will fall to the ground of itself.&rdquo; Within one year
      the Huguenots of France found themselves freed from persecution, and
      in the enjoyment of a measured liberty of public worship. It can scarcely
      be doubted that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg
      189]</a></span> owed this to Catherine de&rsquo; Medici. She was a child
      of the Renaissance, and was naturally on the side of free thought;
      and she was, besides, at this time persuaded that the Huguenots had
      the future on their side. In the coming struggle they regarded this
      edict as their charter, and frequently demanded its restitution and
      enforcement.</p>
<p>Catherine de&rsquo; Medici had shown both courage and constancy in her attempts
      at conciliation. To the remonstrances of Philip of Spain she had replied
      that she meant to be master in her own house; and when the Constable
      de Montmorency had threatened to leave the Court, he had been told
      that he might do as he pleased. But she was soon to be convinced that
      she had overestimated the strength of the Protestants, and that she
      could never count on the consistent support of their nominal leader,
      the vain and vacillating Antoine de Bourbon. Had Jeanne d&rsquo;Albret been
      in her husband&rsquo;s place, things might have been different.</p>
<p>The edict of January 17th, 1562, had exasperated the Romanists without
      satisfying the mass of the Protestants. The marked increase in the
      numbers of Protestant congregations, and their not very strict observance
      of the limitations of the edict, had given rise to disturbances in
      many parts of the country. Everything seemed to tend towards civil
      war. The spark which kindled the conflagration was the Massacre of
      Vassy.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>
<h3>&sect; 12. <i>The Massacre of Vassy.</i></h3>
<p>The Duke of Guise, travelling from Joinville to Paris, accompanied by
      his brother, the Cardinal of Guise, his children and his wife, and
      escorted by a large armed retinue, halted at Vassy (March 1st, 1562).
      It was a Sunday, and the Duke wished to hear Mass. Scarcely a gunshot
      from the church was a barn where the Protestants (in defiance of the
      edict, for Vassy was a walled town) were holding a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg
      190]</a></span> service. The congregation, barely a year old, was numerous
      and zealous. It was an eyesore to Antoinette de Bourbon, the mother
      of the Guises, who lived in the neighbouring ch&acirc;teau of Joinville,
      and saw her dependants attracted by the preaching at Vassy. The Duke
      was exasperated at seeing men whom he counted his subjects defying
      him in his presence. He sent some of his retainers to order the worshippers
      to quit the place. They were received by cries of &ldquo;Papists! idolaters!&rdquo; When
      they attempted to force an entrance, stones began to fly, and the Duke
      was struck. The barn was rushed, the worshippers fusilladed, and before
      the Duke gave orders to cease firing, sixty-three of the six or seven
      hundred Protestants were slain, and over a hundred wounded.</p>
<p>The news of the massacre spread fast; and while it exasperated the Huguenots,
      the Romanists hailed it as a victory. The Constable de Montmorency
      and the Marshal Saint Andr&eacute; went out to meet the Duke, and the
      Guises entered Paris in triumph, escorted by more than three thousand
      armed men. The Protestants began arming themselves, and crowded to
      Paris to place themselves under the orders of the Prince of Cond&eacute;.
      It was feared that the two factions would fight in the streets.</p>
<p>The Regent with the King retired to Fontainebleau. She was afraid of the
      Triumvirs (Montmorency, the Duke of Guise, and Marshal Saint-Andr&eacute;),
      and she invited the Prince de Cond&eacute; to protect her and her children.
      Cond&eacute;
      lost this opportunity of placing himself and his co-religionists in
      the position of being the support of the throne. The Triumvirate, with
      Antoine de Bourbon, who now seemed to be their obedient servant, marched
      on Fontainebleau, and compelled the King and the Queen Mother to return
      to Paris. Catherine believed that the Protestants had abandoned her,
      and turned to the Romanists.</p>
<p>The example of massacre given at Vassy was followed in many places where
      the Romanists were in a majority. In Paris, Sens, Rouen, and elsewhere,
      the Protestant places of worship were attacked, and many of the worshippers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg
      191]</a></span> slain. At Toulouse, the Protestants shut themselves
      up in the Capitol, and were besieged by the Romanists. They at last
      surrendered, trusting to a promise that they would be allowed to leave
      the town in safety. The promise was not kept, and three thousand men,
      women, and children were slain in cold blood. This slaughter, in violation
      of oath, was celebrated by the Roman Catholics of Toulouse in centenary
      festivals, which were held in 1662, in 1762, and would have been celebrated
      in 1862 had the Government of Napoleon <span class="smcap">III.</span> not
      interfered to forbid it.</p>
<p>These massacres provoked reprisals. The Huguenots broke into the Romanist
      churches, tore down the images, defaced the altars, and destroyed the
      relics.</p>
<h3>&sect; 13. <i>The Beginning of the Wars of Religion.</i></h3>
<p>Gradually the parties faced each other with the Duke of Guise and the
      Constable Montmorency at the head of the Romanists, and the Prince
      of Cond&eacute; and Admiral Coligny at the head of the Huguenots. France
      became the scene of a civil conflict, where religious fanaticism added
      its cruelties to the ordinary barbarities of warfare.</p>
<p>The Venetian Ambassador, writing home to the chiefs of his State, was
      of opinion that this first war of religion prevented France from becoming
      Protestant. The cruelties of the Romanists had disgusted a large number
      of Frenchmen, who, though they had no great sympathy for the Protestant
      faith, would have gladly allied themselves with a policy of toleration.
      The Huguenot chiefs themselves saw that the desecration of churches
      did not serve the cause they had at heart. Calvin and de B&egrave;ze
      wrote, energetically urging their followers to refrain from attacks
      on churches, images, and relics. But it was all to no purpose. At Orl&eacute;ans,
      Coligny and Cond&eacute; heard that their men were assaulting the Church
      of the Holy Spirit. They hastened there, and Cond&eacute; saw a Huguenot
      soldier on the roof of the church about to cast an image to the ground.
      Seizing an arquebus, he pointed it at the man, and ordered him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg
      192]</a></span> desist and come down. The soldier did not stop his
      work for an instant. &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;have patience with me until
      I destroy this idol, and then let me die if it be your pleasure.&rdquo; When
      men were content to die rather than refrain from iconoclasm, it was
      in vain to expect to check it. Somehow the slaughter of men made less
      impression than the sack of churches, and moderate men came to the
      opinion that if the Huguenots prevailed, they would be as intolerant
      as the Romanists had been. The rising tide of sympathy for the persecuted
      Protestants was checked by these deeds of violence.</p>
<p>The progress of the war was upon the whole unfavourable to the Huguenots,
      and in the beginning of 1553 both parties were exhausted. The Constable
      Montmorency had been captured by the Huguenots, and the Prince de Cond&eacute;
      by the Romanists. The Duke of Guise was shot from behind by a Huguenot,
      and died six days later (Feb. 24th, 1563). The Marshal Saint-Andr&eacute; and
      Antoine de Bourbon had both died during the course of the war. Catherine
      de&rsquo; Medici was everywhere recognised as the head of the Romanist party.
      She no longer needed the Protestants to counterbalance the Guises and
      the Constable. She could now pursue her own policy.</p>
<p>From this time forward she was decidedly hostile to the Huguenots. She
      had learned the resources and popularity of the Romanists. But she
      disliked fighting, and the religious war was ruining France. Her idea
      was that it would be necessary to tolerate the Protestants, but impossible
      to grant them common rights with the Romanists. She applied herself
      to win over the Prince de Cond&eacute;, who was tired of his captivity.
      Negotiations were opened. Catherine, the Constable, Cond&eacute;, and
      d&rsquo;Andelot met at Orl&eacute;ans; and, after discussion, terms were
      agreed upon (March 7th), and the Edict of Amboise incorporating them
      was published (March 18th, 1563).</p>
<p>Cond&eacute; had asked for the restitution of the edict of Jan. 17th,
      1561, and the strict enforcement of its terms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg
      193]</a></span> This was refused. The terms of the new edict were as
      favourable for men of good birth, but not for others. Cond&eacute; had
      to undergo the reproaches of Coligny, that he had secured rights for
      himself but had betrayed his poorer brethren in the faith; and that
      he had destroyed by his signature more churches than the united forces
      of Romanism had done in ten years. Calvin spoke of him as a poor Prince
      who had betrayed God for his own vanity.</p>
<p>The truce, for it was no more than a truce, concluded by the Edict of
      Amboise lasted nearly five years. It was broken by the Huguenots, who
      were suspicious that Catherine was plotting with the Duke of Alva against
      them. Alva was engaged in a merciless attempt to exterminate the Protestants
      of the Low Countries, and Catherine had been at pains to provide provisions
      for his troops. The Protestant leaders came to the desperate conclusion
      to imitate the Triumvirate in 1561, and seize upon the King&rsquo;s person.
      They failed, and their attempt began the Second War of Religion. The
      indecisive battle of Saint Denis was fought on Nov. 10th, 1567, and
      the Constable Montmorency fell in the fight. Both parties were almost
      exhausted, and the terms of peace were the same as those in the Edict
      of Amboise.</p>
<p>The close of this Second War of Religion saw a determined attempt, mainly
      directed by the Jesuits, to inspire the masses of France with enthusiasm
      for the Roman Catholic Church. Eloquent preachers traversed the land,
      who insisted on the antiquity of the Roman and the novelty of the Protestant
      faith. Brotherhoods were formed, and enrolled men of all sorts and
      conditions of life sworn to bear arms against every kind of heresy.
      Outrages and assassinations of Protestants were common; and the Government
      appeared indifferent. It was, however, the events in the Low Countries
      which again alarmed the Protestants. The Duke of Alva, who had begun
      his rule there with an appearance of gentleness, had suddenly seized
      and executed the Counts Egmont and Horn. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg
      194]</a></span> had appointed a commission to judge the leaders and
      accomplices in the earlier rising&mdash;a commission which from its
      deeds gained for itself the name of the Tribunal of Blood. Huguenot
      soldiers hastened to enrol themselves in the levies which the Prince
      of Orange was raising for the deliverance of his countrymen. But the
      Huguenot leaders had other thoughts. Was Catherine meaning to treat
      them as Alva had treated Egmont and Horn? They found that they were
      watched. The suspicion and suspense became intolerable. Coligny and
      Cond&eacute; resolved to take refuge in La Rochelle. As they passed
      through the country they were joined by numbers of Huguenots, and soon
      became a small army. Their followers were eager to avenge the murders
      committed on those of their faith, and pillage and worse marked the
      track of the army. Cond&eacute; and the Admiral punished some of their
      marauding followers by death; and this, says the chronicler,
      &ldquo;made the violence of the soldier more secret if not more rare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>D&rsquo;Andelot had collected his Normans and Bretons. Jeanne d&rsquo;Albret had roused
      her Gascons and the Proven&ccedil;als, and appeared with her son, Henry
      of Navarre, a boy of fifteen, at the head of her troops. She published
      a manifesto to justify her in taking up arms. In the camp at La Rochelle
      she was the soul of the party, fired their passions, and sustained
      their courage.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>
<p>In the war which followed, the Huguenots were unfortunate. At the battle
      of Jarnac, Cond&eacute;&rsquo;s cavalry was broken by a charge on their flank
      made by the German mercenaries under Tavannes. He fought till he was
      surrounded and dismounted. After he had surrendered he was brutally
      shot in cold blood. The Huguenots soon rallied at Cognac, where the
      Queen of Navarre joined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg
      195]</a></span> them. She presented her son and her nephew, young Henry
      of Cond&eacute;, to the troops, and was received with acclamations.
      Young Henry of Navarre was proclaimed head of the party, and his cousin,
      Henry of Cond&eacute;, a boy of the same age, was associated with him.
      The war went on. The Battle of Moncontour ended in the most disastrous
      defeat the Huguenots had ever sustained. Catherine de&rsquo; Medici thought
      that she had them at her mercy, and proposed terms of submission which
      would have left them liberty of conscience but denied the right to
      worship. The heroic Queen of Navarre declared that the names of Jeanne
      and Henry would never appear on a treaty containing these conditions;
      and Coligny, like his contemporary, William the Silent, was never more
      dangerous than after a defeat. The Huguenots announced themselves ready
      to fight to the last; and Catherine, to her astonishment, saw them
      stronger than ever. An armistice was arranged, and the Edict of Saint-Germain
      (Aug. 8th, 1570) published the terms of peace. It was more favourable
      to the Huguenots than any earlier one. They were guaranteed freedom
      of conscience throughout the whole kingdom. They had the liberty of
      public worship in all places where it had been practised before the
      war, in the suburbs of at least two towns in every government, and
      in the residences of the great nobles. Four strongly fortified towns&mdash;La
      Rochelle, Montauban, Cognac, and La Charit&eacute;&mdash;were to be
      held by them as pledges for at least two years. The King withdrew himself
      from the Spanish alliance and the international policy of the suppression
      of the Protestants. William of Orange and Ludovic of Nassau were declared
      to be his friends, in spite of the fact that they were the rebel subjects
      of Philip of Spain and had assisted the Huguenots in the late war.</p>
<p>After the peace of Saint-Germain, Coligny, now the only great leader left
      to the Huguenots, lived far from the Court at La Rochelle, acting as
      the guardian of the two young Bourbon Princes, Henry of Navarre and
      Henry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> of
      Cond&eacute;. He occupied himself in securing for the Reformed the
      advantages they had won in the recent treaty of peace.</p>
<p>Catherine de&rsquo; Medici had begun to think of strengthening herself at home
      and abroad by matrimonial alliances. She wished one of her sons, whether
      the Duke of Anjou or the Duke of Alen&ccedil;on it mattered little
      to her, to marry Elizabeth of England, and her daughter Marguerite
      to espouse the young King of Navarre. Both designs meant that the Huguenots
      must be conciliated. They were in no hurry to respond to her advances.
      Both Coligny and Jeanne d&rsquo;Albret kept themselves at a distance from
      the Court. Suddenly the young King, Charles <span class="smcap">IX.</span>,
      seemed to awaken to his royal position. He had been hitherto entirely
      submissive to his mother, expending his energies now in hunting, now
      in lock-making; but, if one can judge from what awakened him, cherishing
      a sullen grudge against Philip of Spain and his pretensions to guide
      the policy of Roman Catholic Europe.</p>
<p>Pope Pius <span class="smcap">V.</span> had made Cosmo de&rsquo; Medici, the
      ruler of Florence, a Grand Duke, and Philip of Spain and Maximilian
      of Austria had protested. Cosmo sent an agent to win the German Protestants
      to side with him against Maximilian, and to engage the Dutch Protestants
      to make trouble in the Netherlands. Charles saw the opportunity of
      gratifying his grudge, and entered eagerly into the scheme. His wishes
      did not for the time interfere with his mother&rsquo;s plans. If her marriage
      ideas were to succeed, she must break with Spain. Coligny saw the advantages
      which might come to his fellow-believers in the Netherlands&mdash;help
      in money from Italy and with troops from France. He resolved to make
      his peace with Catherine, respond to her advances, and betake himself
      to Court. He was graciously received, for Catherine wished to make
      use of him; was made a member of the Council, received a gift of one
      hundred and fifty thousand livres, and, although a heretic, was put
      into possession of an Abbey whose revenues amounted to twenty thousand
      livres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span> a
      year. The Protestant chiefs were respectfully listened to when they
      stated grievances, and these were promptly put right, even at the risk
      of exasperating the Romanists. The somewhat unwilling consent of Jeanne
      d&rsquo;Albret was won to the marriage of her son with Marguerite, and she
      herself came to Paris to settle the terms of contract. There she was
      seized with pleurisy, and died&mdash;an irreparable loss to the Protestant
      cause. Catherine&rsquo;s home policy had been successful.</p>
<p>But Elizabeth of England was not to be enticed either into a French marriage
      or a stable French alliance, and Catherine de&rsquo; Medici saw that her
      son&rsquo;s scheme might lead to France being left to confront Spain alone;
      and the Spain of the sixteenth century played the part of Russia in
      the end of the nineteenth&mdash;fascinating the statesmen of the day
      with its gloomy, mysterious, incalculable power. She felt that she
      must detach Charles at whatever cost from his scheme of flouting Philip
      by giving assistance to the Protestants of the Low Countries. Coligny
      was in her way&mdash;recognised to be the greatest statesman in France,
      enthusiastically bent on sending French help to his struggling co-religionists,
      and encouraging Charles <span class="smcap">IX.</span> Coligny must
      be removed. The Guises were at deadly feud with him, and would be useful
      in putting him out of the way. The Ambassador of Florence reported
      significantly conferences between Catherine and the Duchess de Nemours,
      the mother of the Guises (July 23rd, 1572). The Queen had secret interviews
      with Maureval, a professional bravo, who drew a pension as &ldquo;tueur du
      Roy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing could be done until Henry, now King of Navarre by his mother&rsquo;s
      death, was safely married to Marguerite. The wedding took place on
      August 18th, 1572. On Friday (Aug. 22nd), between ten and eleven o&rsquo;clock,
      Coligny left the Louvre to return to his lodging. The assassin was
      stationed in a house belonging to a retainer of the Guises, at a grated
      window concealed by a curtain. The Admiral was walking slowly, reading
      a letter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg
      198]</a></span> Suddenly a shot carried away the index finger of his
      right hand and wounded his left arm. He calmly pointed to the window
      from whence the shot had come; and some of his suite rushed to the
      house, but found nothing but a smoking arquebus. The news reached the
      King when he was playing tennis. He became pallid, threw down his racquet,
      and went to his rooms.</p>
<p>Catherine closeted herself with the Duke of Anjou to discuss a situation
      which was fraught with terror.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>
<h3>&sect; 14. <i>The Massacre of St. Bartholomew.</i></h3>
<p>Paris was full of Huguenot gentlemen, drawn from all parts of the country
      for the wedding of their young chief with the Princess Marguerite.
      They rushed to the house in which Coligny lay. The young King of Navarre
      and his cousin, Henry de Cond&eacute;, went to the King to demand justice,
      which Charles promised would be promptly rendered. Coligny asked to
      see the King, who proposed to go at once. Catherine feared to leave
      the two alone, and accompanied him, attended by a number of her most
      trusty adherents. Even the Duke of Guise was there. The King by Coligny&rsquo;s
      bedside swore again with a great oath that he would avenge the outrage
      in a way that it would never be forgotten. A commission was appointed
      to inquire into the affair, and they promptly discovered that retainers
      of the Guises were implicated. If the investigations were pursued in
      the King&rsquo;s temper, Guise would probably seek to save himself by revealing
      Catherine&rsquo;s share in the attempted assassination. She became more and
      more a prey to terror. The Huguenots grew more and more violent. At
      last Catherine, whether on her own initiative or prompted by others
      will never be known, believed that she could only save herself by a
      prompt and thorough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg
      199]</a></span> massacre of the Huguenots, gathered in unusual numbers
      in Paris.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>
<p>She summoned a council (Aug. 23rd), at which were present, so far as is
      known, the Duke of Anjou, her favourite son, afterwards Henry <span class="smcap">III.</span>,
      Marshal Tavannes, Nevers, Nemours (the stepfather of the Guises), Birago
      (Chancellor), the Count de Retz, and the Chevalier d&rsquo;Angoul&ecirc;me&mdash;four
      of them Italians. They were unanimous in advising an instant massacre.
      Tavannes and Nevers, it is said, pled for and obtained the lives of
      the two young Bourbons, the King of Navarre and the Prince de Cond&eacute;.
      The Count de Retz, who was a favourite with Charles, was engaged to
      win the King&rsquo;s consent by appealing to his fears, and by telling him
      that his mother and brother were as deeply implicated as Guise.</p>
<p>Night had come down before the final resolution was taken; but the fanatical
      and bloodthirsty mob of Paris might be depended upon. At the last moment,
      Tavannes (the son) tells us in his Memoirs, Catherine wished to draw
      back, but the others kept her firm. The Duke of Guise undertook to
      slay Coligny. The Admiral was run through with a pike, and the body
      tossed out of the window into the courtyard where Guise was waiting.
      At the Louvre the young Bourbon Princes were arrested, taken to the
      King, and given their choice between death and the Mass. The other
      Huguenot gentlemen who were in the Louvre were slain. In the morning
      the staircases, balls, and anti-chambers of the Palace were deeply
      stained with blood. When the murders had been done in the Louvre, the
      troops divided into parties and went to seek other victims. Almost
      all the Huguenot gentlemen on the north side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg
      200]</a></span> the river were slain, and all in the Quartier Latin.
      But some who lodged on the south side (among them Montgomery, and Jean
      de Ferri&egrave;res, the Vidame de Chartres) escaped.</p>
<p>Orders were sent to complete the massacre in the provinces. At Orl&eacute;ans
      the slaughter lasted five days, and Protestants were slain in numbers
      at Meaux, Troyes, Rouen, Lyons, Toulouse, Bordeaux, and in many other
      places. The total number of victims has been variously estimated. Sully,
      the Prime Minister of Henry <span class="smcap">IV.</span>, who had
      good means of knowing, says that seventy thousand perished. Several
      thousands were slain in Paris alone.</p>
<p>The news was variously received by Roman Catholic Europe. The German Romanists,
      including the Emperor, were not slow to express their disapprobation.
      But Rome was illuminated in honour of the event, a medal was struck
      to commemorate the <i>Hugonotorum Strages</i>,<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> and
      Cardinal Orsini was sent to convey to the King and Queen Mother the
      congratulations of the Pope and the College of Cardinals. Philip of
      Spain was delighted, and is said to have laughed outright for the first
      and last time in his life. He congratulated the son on having such
      a mother, and the mother on having such a son.</p>
<p>Catherine herself believed that the massacre had ended all her troubles.
      The Huguenots had been annihilated, she thought; and it is reported
      that when she saw Henry of Navarre bowing to the altar she burst out
      into a shrill laugh.</p>
<h3>&sect; 15. <i>The Huguenot resistance after the Massacre.</i></h3>
<p>Catherine&rsquo;s difficulties were not ended. It was not so easy to exterminate
      the Huguenots. Most of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg
      201]</a></span> leaders had perished, but the people remained, cowed
      for a time undoubtedly, but soon to regain their courage. The Protestants
      held the strongholds of La Rochelle and Sancerre, the one on the coast
      and the other in central France. The artisans and the small shopkeepers
      insisted that there should be no surrender. The sailors of La Rochelle
      fraternised with the Sea-Beggars of Brill, and waged an implacable
      sea-war against the ships of Spain. Nimes and Montauban closed their
      gates against the soldiers of the King. Milhaud, Aubenas, Privas, Mirabel,
      Anduze, Sommi&egrave;res, and other towns of the Viverais and of the
      Cevennes became cities of refuge. All over France, the Huguenots, although
      they had lost their leaders, kept together, armed themselves, communicated
      with each other, maintained their religious services&mdash;though compelled
      generally to meet at night.</p>
<p>The attempt to capture these Protestant strongholds made the Fourth Religious
      War. La Rochelle was invested, beat back many assaults, was blockaded
      and endured famine, and in the end compelled its enemies to retire
      from its walls. Sancerre was less fortunate. After the failure of an
      attempt to take it by assault, La Ch&acirc;tre, the general of the
      besieging army, blockaded the town in the closest fashion. The citizens
      endured all the utmost horrors of famine. Five hundred adults and all
      the children under twelve years of age died of hunger. &ldquo;Why weep,&rdquo; said
      a boy of ten, &ldquo;to see me die of hunger? I do not ask bread, mother:
      I know that you have none. Since God wills that I die, thus we must
      accept it cheerfully. Was not that good man Lazarus hungry? Have I
      not so read in the Bible?&rdquo; The survivors surrendered: their lives were
      spared; and on payment of a ransom of forty thousand livres the town
      was not pillaged.</p>
<p>The war ended with the peace of Rochelle (July 1573), when liberty of
      conscience was accorded to all, but the right of public worship was
      permitted only to Rochelle, Nimes, Montauban, and in the houses of
      some of the principal Protestant nobles. These terms were hard in comparison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg
      202]</a></span> with the rights which had been won before the Massacre
      of Saint Bartholomew; but the Huguenots had reason for rejoicing. Their
      cause was still alive. Neither war, nor massacre, nor frauds innumerable
      had made any impression on the great mass of the French Protestants.</p>
<p>The peace declared by the treaty of La Rochelle did not last long, and
      indeed was never universal. The Protestants of the South used it to
      prepare for a renewal of conflict. They remained under arms, perfecting
      their military organisation. They divided the districts which they
      controlled into regular governments, presided over by councils whose
      members were elected and were the military leaders of a Protestant
      nation for the time being separate from the kingdom of France. They
      imposed taxes on Romanists and Protestants, and confiscated the ecclesiastical
      revenues. They were able to stock their strongholds with provisions
      and munitions of war, and maintain a force of twenty thousand men ready
      for offensive action.</p>
<p>Their councils at Nimes and Montauban formulated the conditions under
      which they would submit to the French Government. Nimes sent a deputation
      to the King furnished with a series of written articles, in which they
      demanded the free exercise of their religion in every part of France,
      the maintenance at royal expense of Huguenot garrisons in all the strongholds
      held by them, and the cession of two strong posts to be cities of refuge
      in each of the provinces of France. The demands of the council of Montauban
      went further. They added that the King must condemn the Massacre of
      St. Bartholomew, execute justice on those who had perpetrated it, reverse
      the sentences passed on all the victims, approve of the Huguenot resistance,
      and declare that he praised <i>la singuli&egrave;re et admirable bont&eacute; de
      Dieu</i> who had still preserved his Protestant subjects. They required
      also that the rights of the Protestant minority in France should be
      guaranteed by the Protestant States of Europe&mdash;by the German Protestant
      Princes, by Switzerland, England, and Scotland. They dated their document
      significantly August 24th&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg
      203]</a></span> anniversary of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew. The
      deputies refused to discuss these terms; they simply presented them.
      The King might accept them; he might refuse them. They were not to
      be modified.</p>
<p>Catherine was both furious and confounded at the audacity of these &ldquo;rascals&rdquo; (<i>ces
            mis&eacute;rables</i>), as she called them. She declared that
            Cond&eacute;, if he had been at the head of twenty thousand cavalry
            and fifty thousand infantry, would never have asked for the half
            of what these articles demanded. The Queen Mother found herself
            face to face with men on whom she might practise all her arts
            in vain, very different from the <i>debonnaire</i> Huguenot princes
            whom she had been able to cajole with feminine graces and enervate
            with her &ldquo;Flying Squadron.&rdquo; These farmers, citizens, artisans
            knew her and her Court, and called things by rude names. She
            herself was a &ldquo;murderess,&rdquo; and her
      &ldquo;Flying Squadron&rdquo; were &ldquo;fallen women.&rdquo; She had cleared away the Huguenot
      aristocracy to find herself in presence of the Protestant democracy.</p>
<p>The worst of it was that she dared not allow the King to give them a decided
      answer. A new force had been rising in France since Saint Bartholomew&rsquo;s
      Day&mdash;the <i>Politiques</i>,<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> as
      they were called. They put France above religious parties, and were
      weary of the perpetual bloodshed; they said that &ldquo;a man does not cease
      to be a citizen because he is excommunicated&rdquo;; they declared that &ldquo;with
      the men they had lost in the religious wars they could have driven
      Spain out of the Low Countries.&rdquo; They chafed under the rule of &ldquo;foreigners,&rdquo; of
      the Queen Mother and her Italians, of the Guises and their Jesuits.
      They were prepared to unite with the Huguenots in order to give France
      peace. They only required leaders who could represent the two sides
      of the coalition. If the Duke of Alen&ccedil;on, the youngest brother
      of the King, and Henry of Navarre could escape from the Court and raise
      their standards together, they were prepared to join them.</p>
<p>Charles <span class="smcap">IX.</span> died on Whitsunday 1574 of a disease<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg
                  204]</a></span> which the tainted blood of the Valois and
                  the M&eacute;dicis induced. The memories of Saint Bartholomew
                  also hastened his death. Private memoirs of courtiers tell
                  us that in his last weeks of fever he had frightful dreams
                  by day and by night. He saw himself surrounded by dead
                  bodies; hideous faces covered with blood thrust themselves
                  forward towards his. The crime had not been so much his
                  as his mother&rsquo;s, but <i>he</i> had something of a conscience,
                  and felt its burden. &ldquo;Et ma M&egrave;re&rdquo; was his last word&mdash;an
                  appeal to his mother, whom he feared more than his God.</p>
<p>On Charles&rsquo; death, Henry, Duke of Anjou, succeeded as Henry <span class="smcap">III.</span><a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> He
      was in Poland&mdash;king of that distracted country. He abandoned his
      crown, evaded his subjects, and reached France in September 1574. His
      advent did not change matters much. Catherine still ruled in reality.
      The war went on with varying success in different parts of France.
      But the Duke of Anjou (the Duke of Alen&ccedil;on took this title on
      his brother&rsquo;s accession) succeeded in escaping from Court (Sept. 15th,
      1575), and the King of Navarre also managed to elude his guardians
      (Feb. 3rd, 1576). Anjou joined the Prince of Cond&eacute;, who was
      at the head of a mixed force of Huguenots and Politiques. Henry of
      Navarre went into Poitou and remained there. His first act was to attend
      the Protestant worship, and immediately afterwards he renounced his
      forced adhesion to Romanism. He did not join any of the parties in
      the field, but sent on his own demands to be forwarded to the King
      along with those of the confederates, adding to them the request that
      the King should aid him to recover the Spanish part of Navarre which
      had been forcibly annexed to Spain by Ferdinand of Aragon.</p>
<p>The escape of the two Princes led in the end to the
      &ldquo;Peace of Monsieur,&rdquo; the terms of which were published in the Edict
      of Beaulieu (May 6th, 1576). The right of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg
      205]</a></span> public worship was given to Protestants in all towns
      and places within the kingdom of France, Paris only and towns where
      the Court was residing being excepted. Protestants received eight strongholds,
      partly as cities of refuge and partly as guarantees. Chambers of Justice &ldquo;mi-parties&rdquo;
      (composed of both Protestants and Roman Catholics) were established
      in each Parliament. The King actually apologised for the Massacre of
      Saint Bartholomew, and declared that it had happened to his great regret;
      and all sentences pronounced on the victims were reversed. This edict
      was much more favourable to the Protestants than any that had gone
      before. Almost all the Huguenots&rsquo; demands had been granted.</p>
<h3>&sect; 16. <i>The beginnings of the League.</i></h3>
<p>Neither the King, who felt himself humiliated, nor the Romanists, who
      were indignant, were inclined to submit long to the terms of peace.
      Some of the Romanist leaders had long seen that the Huguenot enthusiasm
      and their organisation were enabling an actual minority to combat,
      on more than equal terms, a Romanist majority. Some of the provincial
      leaders had been able to inspire their followers with zeal, and to
      bind them together in an organisation by means of leagues. These provincial
      leagues suggested a universal organisation, which was fostered by Henry,
      Duke of Guise, and by Catherine de&rsquo; Medici. This was the first form
      of that celebrated League which gave twenty years&rsquo; life to the civil
      war in France. The Duke of Guise published a declaration in which he
      appealed to all France to associate together in defence of the Holy
      Church, Catholic and Roman, and of their King Henry <span class="smcap">III.</span>,
      whose authority and rights were being taken from him by rebels. All
      good Catholics were required to join the association, and to furnish
      arms for the accomplishment of its designs. Those who refused were
      to be accounted enemies. Neutrals were to be harassed with &ldquo;toutes
      sortes d&rsquo;offences et molestes&rdquo;; open foes were to be fought strenuously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg
      206]</a></span> Paris was easily won to the League, and agents were
      sent abroad throughout France to enrol recruits. Henry <span class="smcap">III.</span> himself
      was enrolled, and led the movement.</p>
<p>The King had summoned the States General to meet at Blois and hold their
      first session there on Dec. 6th, 1576. The League had attended to the
      elections, and the Estates declared unanimously for unity of religion.
      Upon this the King announced that the Edict of Beaulieu had been extracted
      from him by force, and that he did not intend to keep it. Two of the
      Estates, the Clergy and the Nobles, were prepared to compel unity at
      any cost. The Third Estate was divided. A minority wished the unity
      brought about &ldquo;by gentle and pacific ways&rdquo;; the majority asked for
      the immediate and complete suppression of the public worship of the
      Protestants, and for the banishment of all ministers, elders, and deacons.</p>
<p>These decisions of the States General were taken by the Huguenots as a
      declaration of war, and they promptly began to arm themselves. It was
      the first war of the League, and the sixth of Religion. It ended with
      the Peace of Bergerac (Sept. 15th, 1578), in which the terms granted
      to the Huguenots were rather worse than those of the Edict of Beaulieu.
      A seventh war ensued, terminated by the Peace of Fleix (Nov. 1580).</p>
<p>The Duke of Anjou died (June 10th, 1584), and the King had no son. The
      heir to the throne, according to the Salic Law, which excluded females,
      was Henry of Navarre, a Protestant. On the death of Anjou, Henry <span class="smcap">III.</span> found
      himself face to face with this fact. He knew and felt that he was the
      guardian of the dynastic rights of the French throne, and that his
      duty was to acknowledge Henry of Navarre as his successor. He accordingly
      sent one of his favourites, &Eacute;peron, to prevail upon Henry of
      Navarre to become a Roman Catholic and come to Court. Henry refused
      to do either.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></p>
<h3>&sect; 17. <i>The League becomes disloyal.</i><a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></h3>
<p>Meanwhile the Romanist nobles were taking their measures. Some of them
      met at Nancy towards the close of 1584 to reconstruct the League. They
      resolved to exclude the Protestant Bourbons from the throne, and proclaim
      the Cardinal Bourbon as the successor of Henry <span class="smcap">III.</span> They
      hoped to obtain a Bull from the Pope authorising this selection; and
      they received the support of Philip of Spain in the Treaty of Joinville
      (Dec. 31st, 1584).</p>
<p>Paris did not wait for the sanction or recommendation of the nobles. A
      contemporary anonymous pamphlet, which is the principal source of our
      information, describes how four men, three of them ecclesiastics, met
      together to found the League of Paris. They discussed the names of
      suitable members, and, having selected a nucleus of trustworthy associates,
      they proceeded to elect a secret council of eight or nine who were
      to direct and control everything. The active work of recruiting was
      superintended by six associates, of whom one, the Sieur de la Rocheblond,
      was a member of the secret council. Soon all the most fanatical elements
      of the population of Paris belonged to this secret society, sworn to
      obey blindly the orders of the mysterious council who from a concealed
      background directed everything. The corporations of the various trades
      were won to the League; the butchers of Paris, for example, furnished
      a band of fifteen hundred resolute and dangerous men. Trusty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg
      208]</a></span> emissaries were sent to the large towns of France,
      and secret societies on the plan of the one in Paris were formed and
      affiliated with the mother-society in Paris, all bound to execute the
      orders of the secret council of the capital. The Sieur de la Rocheblond,
      whose brain had planned the whole organisation, was the medium of communication
      with the Romanist Princes; and through him Henry, Duke of Guise, le
      Balafr&eacute; as he was called from a scar on his face, was placed
      in command of this new and formidable instrument, to be wielded as
      he thought best for the extirpation of the Protestantism of France.</p>
<p>The King had published an edict forbidding all armed assemblies, and this
      furnished the Leaguers with a pretext for sending forth their manifesto: <i>D&eacute;claration
      des causes qui ont meu Monseigneur le Cardinal de Bourbon et les Pairs,
      Princes, Seigneurs, villes et communautez catholiques de ce royaume
      de France: De s&rsquo;opposer &agrave; ceux qui par tous moyens s&rsquo;efforcent
      de subvertir la religion catholique et l&rsquo;Estat (30 Mars 1585).</i> It
      was a skilfully drafted document, setting forth the danger to religion
      in the foreground, but touching on all the evils and jealousies which
      had arisen from the favouritism of Henry <span class="smcap">III.</span> Guise
      at once began to enrol troops and commence open hostilities; and almost
      all the great towns of France and most of the provinces in the North
      and in the Centre declared for the League.</p>
<p>Henry <span class="smcap">III.</span> was greatly alarmed. With the help
      of his mother he negotiated a treaty with the Leaguers, in which he
      promised to revoke all the earlier Edicts of Toleration, to prohibit
      the exercise of Protestant public worship throughout the kingdom, to
      banish the ministers, and to give all Protestants the choice between
      becoming Roman Catholics or leaving the realm within six months (Treaty
      of Nemours, July 7th, 1585). These terms were embodied in an edict
      dated July 18th, 1585. The Pope, Sixtus <span class="smcap">V.</span>,
      thereupon published a Bull, which declared that the King of Navarre
      and the Prince of Cond&eacute;, being heretics, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg
      209]</a></span> incapable of succeeding to the throne of France, deprived
      them of their estates, and absolved all their vassals from allegiance.
      The King of Navarre replied to &ldquo;Monsieur Sixtus, self-styled Pope,
      saving His Holiness,&rdquo; and promised to avenge the insult done to himself
      and to the <i>Parlements</i> of France.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The war of the three Henrys,&rdquo; from Henry <span class="smcap">III.</span>,
      Henry of Guise, and Henry of Navarre, began in the later months of
      1585. It was in some respects a triangular fight; for although the
      King and the Guises were both ostensibly combating the Huguenots, the
      Leaguers, headed by Guises, and the Loyalists, were by no means whole-hearted
      allies. It began unfavourably for the Protestants, but as it progressed
      the skilful generalship of the King of Navarre became more and more
      apparent&mdash;at Coutras (Oct. 20th, 1587) he almost annihilated the
      royalist army. The King made several ineffectual attempts to win the
      Protestant leader to his side. Navarre would never consent to abjure
      his faith, and Henry <span class="smcap">III.</span> made that an absolute
      condition.</p>
<p>While the war was going on in the west and centre of France, the League
      was strengthening its organisation and perfecting its plans. It had
      become more and more hostile to Henry <span class="smcap">III.</span>,
      and had become a secret revolutionary society. It drafted a complete
      programme for the immediate future. The cities and districts of France
      which felt themselves specially threatened by the Huguenots were to
      beseech the King to raise levies for their protection. If he refused
      or procrastinated, they were to raise the troops themselves, to be
      commanded by officers in whom the League had confidence. They could
      then compel the King to place himself at the head of this army of the
      Leaguers, or show himself to be their open enemy by refusing. If the
      King died childless, the partisans of the League were to gather at
      Orl&eacute;ans and Paris, and were there to elect the Cardinal de Bourbon
      as the King of France. The Pope and the King of Spain were to be at
      once informed, when it had been arranged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg
      210]</a></span> that His Holiness would send his benediction, and that
      His Majesty would assist them with troops and supplies. A new form
      of oath was imposed on all the associates of the League. They were
      to swear allegiance to the King so long as he should show himself to
      be a good Catholic and refrained from favouring heretics. These instructions
      were sent down from the mother-society in Paris to the provinces, and
      the affiliated societies were recommended to keep in constant communication
      with Paris. Madame de Montpensier, sister to the Guises, at the same
      time directed the work of a band of preachers whose business it was
      to inflame the minds of the people in the capital and the provinces
      against the King and the Huguenots. She boasted that she did more work
      for the cause than her brothers were doing by the sword.</p>
<p>The Guises, with this force behind them, tried to force the King to make
      new concessions&mdash;to publish the decisions of the Council of Trent
      in France (a thing that had not been done); to establish the Inquisition
      in France; to order the execution of all Huguenot prisoners who would
      not promise to abjure their religion; and to remove from the armies
      all officers of whom the League did not approve. The mother-society
      in Paris prepared for his refusal by organising a secret revolutionary
      government for the city. It was called &ldquo;The Sixteen,&rdquo; being one for
      each of the sixteen sections of Paris. This government was under the
      orders of Guise, who communicated with them through an agent of his
      called Mayneville. Plot after plot was made to get possession of the
      King&rsquo;s person; and but for the activity and information of Nicholas
      Poulain, an officer of police who managed to secure private information,
      they would have been successful.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></p>
<h3>&sect; 18. <i>The Day of Barricades.</i><a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></h3>
<p>The King redoubled his guards, and ordered four thousand Swiss troops
      which he had stationed at Lagny into the suburbs of Paris. The Parisian
      Leaguers in alarm sent for the Duke of Guise; and Guise, in spite of
      a prohibitive order from the King, entered the city. When he was recognised
      he was received with acclamations by the Parisian crowd. The Queen-Mother
      induced the King to receive him, which he did rather ungraciously.
      Officers and men devoted to the League crowded into Paris. The King,
      having tried in vain to prevent the entry of all suspected persons,
      at last ordered the Swiss into Paris (May 12th, 1588). The citizens
      flew to arms, and converted Paris into a stronghold. It was &ldquo;the day
      of Barricades.&rdquo; Chains were stretched across the streets, and behind
      them were piled beams, benches, carts, great barrels filled with stones
      or gravel. Houses were loop-holed and windows protected. Behind these
      defences men were stationed with arquebuses; and the women and children
      were provided with heaps of stones. Guise had remained in his house,
      but his officers were to be seen moving through the crowds and directing
      the defence. The Swiss troops found themselves caught in a trap, and
      helpless. Henry <span class="smcap">III.</span> was compelled to ask
      Guise to interfere in order to save his soldiers. The King had to undergo
      further humiliation. The citizens proposed to attack the Louvre and
      seize the King&rsquo;s person. Guise had to be appealed to again. He had
      an interview with the King on the 13th, at which Henry <span class="smcap">III.</span> was
      forced to agree to all the demands of the League, and to leave the
      conduct of the war against the Huguenots in the hands of the leader
      of the League. After the interview the King was able to escape secretly
      from Paris.</p>
<p>The day of the &ldquo;Barricades&rdquo; had proved to Henry <span class="smcap">III.</span> that
      the League was master in his capital. The meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg
      212]</a></span> of the States General at Blois (Oct. 1588) was to show
      him that the country had also turned against him.</p>
<p>The elections had been looked after by the Guises, and had taken place
      while the impression produced by the revolt of Paris was at its height.
      The League commanded an immense majority in all the three Estates.
      The business before them was grave. The finances of the kingdom were
      in disorder; favouritism had not been got rid of; and no one could
      trust the King&rsquo;s word. Above all, the religious question was embittering
      every mind. The Estates met under the influence of a religious exaltation
      fanned by the priests. On the 9th of Oct. representatives of the three
      Estates went to Mass together. During the communion the assistant clergy
      chanted the well-known hymns,&mdash;<i>Pange lingua gloriosi, O salutaris
      Hostia, Ave verum Corpus natum</i>,&mdash;and the excitement was immense.
      The members of the Estates had never been so united.</p>
<p>Yet the King had a moment of unwonted courage. He had resolved to denounce
      the League as the source of the disorders in the kingdom. He declared
      that he would not allow a League to exist within the realm. He only
      succeeded in making the leaders furious. His bravado soon ceased. The
      Cardinal de Bourbon compelled him to omit from the published version
      of his speech the objectionable expressions. The Estates forced him
      to swear that he would not permit any religion within the kingdom but
      the Roman. This done, he was received with cries of <i>Vive le Roi</i>,
      and was accompanied to his house with acclamations. But he was compelled
      to see the Duke of Guise receive the office of Lieutenant-General,
      which placed the army under his command; and he felt that he would
      never be &ldquo;master in his own house&rdquo; until that man had been removed
      from his path.</p>
<p>The news of the completeness of the destruction of the Armada had been
      filtering through France; the fear of Spain was to some extent removed,
      and England might help the King if he persisted in a policy of tolerating
      his Protestant subjects. It is probable that he confided his project<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg
      213]</a></span> of getting rid of Guise to some of his more intimate
      councillors, and that they assured him that it would be impossible
      to remove such a powerful subject by legal means. The Duke and his
      brother the Cardinal of Guise were summoned to a meeting of the Council.
      They had scarcely taken their seats when they were asked to see the
      King in his private apartments. There Guise was assassinated, and the
      Cardinal arrested, and slain the next day.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> The
      Cardinal de Bourbon and the young Prince de Joinville (now Duke of
      Guise by his father&rsquo;s death) were arrested and imprisoned. Orders were
      given to arrest the Duchess of Nemours (Guise&rsquo;s mother), the Duke and
      Duchess of Elb&#339;uf, the Count de Brissac, and other prominent Leaguers.
      The King&rsquo;s guards invaded the sittings of the States General to carry
      out these orders. The bodies of the two Guises were burnt, and the
      ashes thrown into the Loire.</p>
<p>The news of the assassination raised the wildest rage in Paris. The League
      proclaimed itself a revolutionary society. The city organised itself
      in its sections. A council was appointed for each section to strengthen
      the hands of the
      &ldquo;Sixteen.&rdquo; Preachers caused their audiences to swear that they would
      spend the last farthing in their purses and the last drop of blood
      in their bodies to avenge the slaughtered princes. The Sorbonne in
      solemn conclave declared that the actions of Henry <span class="smcap">III.</span> had
      absolved his subjects from their allegiance. The &ldquo;Sixteen&rdquo; drove from <i>Parlement</i> all
      suspected persons; and, thus purged, the <i>Parlement</i> of Paris
      ranged itself on the side of the revolution. The Duke of Mayenne, the
      sole surviving brother of Henry of Guise, was summoned to Paris. An
      assembly of the citizens of the capital elected a <i>Council General
      of the Union of Catholics</i> to manage the affairs of the State and
      to confer with all the Catholic towns and provinces of France. Deputies
      sent by these towns and provinces were to be members of the Council.
      The Duke of Mayenne was appointed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg
      214]</a></span> Council the <i>Lieutenant-General of the State and
      Crown of France</i>. The new Government had its seal&mdash;<i>the Seal
      of the Kingdom of France</i>. The larger number of the great towns
      of France adhered to this provisional and revolutionary Government.</p>
<p>In the midst of these tumults Catherine de&rsquo; Medici died (Jan. 5th, 1589).</p>
<h3>&sect; 19. <i>The King takes refuge with the Huguenots.</i></h3>
<p>The miserable King had no resource left but to throw himself upon the
      protection of the Protestants. He hesitated at first, fearing threatened
      papal excommunication. Henry of Navarre&rsquo;s bearing during these months
      of anxiety had been admirable. After the meeting of the States General
      at Blois, he had issued a stirring appeal to the nation, pleading for
      peace&mdash;the one thing needed for the distracted and fevered country.
      He now assured the King of his loyalty, and promised that he would
      never deny to Roman Catholics that liberty of conscience and worship
      which he claimed. A treaty was arranged, and the King of Navarre went
      to meet Henry <span class="smcap">III.</span> at Tours. He arrived
      just in time. Mayenne at the head of an avenging army of Leaguers had
      started as soon as the provisional government had been established
      in Paris. He had taken by assault a suburb of the town, and was about
      to attack the city of Tours itself, when he found the Protestant vanguard
      guarding the bridge over the Loire, and had to retreat. He was slowly
      forced back towards Paris. The battle of Senlis, in which a much smaller
      force of Huguenots routed the Duke d&rsquo;Aumale, who had been reinforced
      by the Parisian militia, opened the way to Paris. The King of Navarre
      pressed on. Town after town was taken, and the forces of the two kings,
      increased by fourteen thousand Swiss and Germans, were soon able to
      seize the bridge of St. Cloud and invest the capital on the south and
      west (July 29th, 1589). An assault was fixed for Aug. 2nd.</p>
<p>Since the murder of the Guises, Paris had been a caldron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg
                  215]</a></span> of seething excitement. The whole population, &ldquo;<i>avec
                  douleur et gemissements bien grands</i>,&rdquo; had assisted
                  at the funeral service for &ldquo;the Martyrs,&rdquo; and the baptism
                  of the posthumous son of the slaughtered Duke had been
                  a civic ceremony. The Bull &ldquo;monitory&rdquo; of Pope Sixtus <span class="smcap">V.</span>,
                  posted up in Rome on May 24th, which directed Henry <span class="smcap">III.</span> on
                  pain of excommunication to release the imprisoned prelates
                  within ten days, and to appear either personally or by
                  proxy within sixty days before the Curia to answer for
                  the murder of a Prince of the Church, had fanned the excitement.
                  Almost every day the Parisians saw processions of students,
                  of women, of children, defiling through their streets.
                  They marched from shrine to shrine, with naked feet, clad
                  only in their shirts, defying the cold of winter. Parishioners
                  dragged their priests out of bed to head nocturnal processions.
                  The hatred of Henry <span class="smcap">III.</span> became
                  almost a madness. The Cordeliers decapitated his portraits.
                  Parish priests made images of the King in wax, placed them
                  on their altars, and practised on them magical incantations,
                  in the hope of doing deadly harm to the living man. Bands
                  of children carried lighted candles, which they extinguished
                  to cries of, &ldquo;<i>God extinguish thus the race of the Valois.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the most excited members of this fevered throng was a young Jacobin
      monk, Jacques Cl&eacute;ment, by birth a peasant, of scanty intelligence,
      and rough, violent manners. His excitement grew with the perils of
      the city. He consulted a theologian in whom he had confidence, and
      got from him a guarded answer that it might be lawful to slay a tyrant.
      He prayed, fasted, went through a course of maceration of the body.
      He saw visions. He believed that he heard voices, and that he received
      definite orders to give his life in order to slay the King. He confided
      his purpose to friends, who approved of it and helped his preparations.
      He was able to leave the city, to pass through the beleaguering lines,
      and to get private audience of the King. He presented a letter, and
      while Henry was reading it stabbed him in the lower part of the body.
      The deed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg
      216]</a></span> done, the monk raised himself to his full height, extended
      his arms to form himself into a crucifix, and received without flinching
      his deathblow from La Guesle and other attendants (Aug. 1st, 1589).<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>
<p>The King lingered until the following morning, and then expired, commending
      Henry of Navarre to his companions as his legitimate successor.</p>
<p>The news of the assassination was received in Paris with wild delight.
      The Duchess de Nemours, the mother of the Guises, and the Duchess de
      Montpensier, their sister, went everywhere in the streets describing &ldquo;the
      heroic act of Jacques Cl&eacute;ment.&rdquo; The former mounted the steps
      of the High Altar in the church of the Cordeliers to proclaim the news
      to the people. The citizens, high and low, brought out their tables
      into the streets, and they drank, sang, shouted and danced in honour
      of the news. They swore that they would never accept a Protestant king<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> and
      the Cardinal de Bourbon, still a prisoner, was proclaimed as Charles
      x.</p>
<p>At Tours, on the other hand, the fact that the heir to the throne was
      a Protestant, threw the Roman Catholic nobles into a state of perplexity.
      They had no sympathy with the League, but many felt that they could
      not serve a Protestant king. They pressed round the new King, beseeching
      him to abjure his faith at once. Henry refused to do what would humiliate
      himself, and could not be accepted as an act of sincerity. On the other
      hand, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg
      217]</a></span> nobles of Champagne, Picardy, and the Isle of France
      sent assurances of allegiance; the Duke of Montpensier, the husband
      of the Leaguer Duchess, promised his support; and the Swiss mercenaries
      declared that they would serve for two months without pay.</p>
<h3>&sect; 20. <i>The Declaration of Henry <span class="smcap">IV.</span></i><a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></h3>
<p>Thus encouraged, Henry published his famous declaration (Aug. 4th, 1589).
      He promised that the Roman Catholic would remain the religion of the
      realm, and that he would attempt no innovations. He declared that he
      was willing to be instructed in its tenets, and that within six months,
      if it were possible, he would summon a National Council. The Roman
      Catholics would be retained in their governments and charges; the Protestants
      would keep the strongholds which were at present in their hands; but
      all fortified places when reduced would be entrusted to Roman Catholics
      and none other. This declaration was signed by two Princes of the Blood,
      the Prince of Conti and the Duke of Montpensier; by three Dukes and
      Peers, Longueville, Luxembourg-Piney, and Rohan-Montbazon; by two Marshals
      of France, Biron and d&rsquo;Aumont; and by several great officers. Notwithstanding,
      the defections were serious; all the <i>Parlements</i> save that of
      Bordeaux thundered against the heretic King; all the great towns save
      Tours, Bordeaux, Ch&acirc;lons, Langres, Compi&egrave;gne, and Clermont
      declared for the League. The greater part of the kingdom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg
      218]</a></span> was in revolt. The royalist troops dwindled away. It
      was hopeless to think of attacking Paris, and Henry <span class="smcap">IV.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg
      219]</a></span> marched for Normandy with scarcely seven thousand men.
      He wished to be on the sea coast in hope of succour from England.</p>
<p>The Duke of Mayenne followed him with an army of thirty thousand men.
      He had promised to the Parisians to throw the &ldquo;Bearnese&rdquo; into the sea,
      or to bring him in chains to Paris, But it was not so easy to catch
      the
      &ldquo;Bearnese.&rdquo; In the series of marches, countermarches, and skirmishes
      which is known as the battle of Arques, the advantage was on the side
      of the King; and when Mayenne attempted to take Dieppe by assault,
      he was badly defeated (Sept. 24th, 1589). Then followed marches and
      countermarches; the King now threatening Paris and then retreating,
      until at last the royalist troops and the Leaguers met at Ivry. The
      King had two thousand cavalry and eight thousand infantry to meet eight
      thousand cavalry and twelve thousand infantry (including seventeen
      hundred Spanish troops sent by the Duke of Parma) under the command
      of Mayenne. The battle resulted in a surprising and decisive victory
      for the King. Mayenne and his cousin d&rsquo;Aumale escaped only by the swiftness
      of their horses (March 14th, 1590).</p>
<p>It is needless to say much about the war or about the schemes of parties.
      Henry invested Paris, and had almost starved it into surrender, when
      it was revictualled by an army led from the Low Countries by the Duke
      of Parma. Henry took town after town, and gradually isolated the capital.
      In 1590 (May 10th) the old Cardinal Bourbon (Charles X.) died, and
      the Leaguers lost even the semblance of a legitimate king. The more
      fanatical members of the party, represented by the &ldquo;Sixteen&rdquo; of Paris,
      would have been content to place France under the dominion of Spain
      rather than see a heretic king. The Duke of Mayenne had long cherished
      dreams that the crown might come to him. But the great mass of the
      influential people of France who had not yet professed allegiance to
      Henry <span class="smcap">IV.</span> (and many who had) had an almost
      equal dread of Spanish domination and of a heretic ruler.</p>
<h3>&sect; 21. <i>Henry <span class="smcap">IV.</span> becomes a Roman Catholic.</i></h3>
<p>Henry at last resolved to conform to the Roman Catholic religion as the
      only means of giving peace to his distracted kingdom. He informed the
      loyalist Archbishop of Bourges of his intention to be instructed in
      the Roman Catholic religion with a view to conversion. The Archbishop
      was able to announce this at the conference of Suresnes, and the news
      spread instantly over France. With his usual tact, Henry wrote with
      his own hand to several of the parish priests of Paris announcing his
      intention, and invited them to meet him at Mantes to give him instruction.
      At least one of them had been a furious Leaguer, and was won to be
      an enthusiastic loyalist.</p>
<p>The ceremony of the reception of Henry <span class="smcap">IV.</span> into
      the Roman Catholic Church took place at Saint Denis, about four and
      a half miles to the north of Paris. The scene had all the appearance
      of some popular festival. The ancient church in which the Kings of
      France had for generations been buried, in which Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc had hung
      up her arms, was decked with splendid tapestries, and the streets leading
      to it festooned with flowers. Multitudes of citizens had come from
      rebel Paris to swell the throng and to shout <i>Vive le Roi!</i> as
      Henry, escorted by a brilliant procession of nobles and guards, passed
      slowly to the church. The clergy, headed by the Archbishop of Bourges,
      met him at the door. The King dismounted, knelt, swore to live and
      die in the catholic apostolic and Roman religion, and renounced all
      the heresies which it condemned. The Archbishop gave him absolution,
      took him by the hand and led him into the church. There, kneeling before
      the High Altar, the King repeated his oath, confessed, and communicated.
      France had now a Roman Catholic as well as a legitimate King. Even
      if it be admitted that Henry <span class="smcap">IV.</span> was not
      a man of any depth of religious feeling, the act of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg
      220]</a></span> abjuration must have been a humiliation for the son
      of Jeanne d&rsquo;Albret. He never was a man who wore his heart on his sleeve,
      and his well-known saying, that &ldquo;Paris was well worth a Mass,&rdquo; had
      as much bitterness in it as gaiety. He had paled with suppressed passion
      at Tours (1589) when the Roman Catholic nobles had urged him to become
      a Romanist. Had the success which followed his arms up to the battle
      of Ivry continued unbroken, it is probable that the ceremony at Saint
      Denis would never have taken place. But Parma&rsquo;s invasion of France,
      which compelled the King to raise the siege of Paris, was the beginning
      of difficulties which seemed insurmountable. The dissensions of parties
      within the realm, and the presence of foreigners on the soil of France
      (Walloon, Spanish, Neapolitan, and Savoyard), were bringing France
      to the verge of dissolution. Henry believed that there was only one
      way to end the strife, and he sacrificed his convictions to his patriotism.</p>
<p>With Henry&rsquo;s change of religion the condition of things changed as if
      by magic. The League seemed to dissolve. Tenders of allegiance poured
      in from all sides, from nobles, provinces, and towns. Rheims was still
      in possession of the Guises, and the anointing and crowning took place
      at Chartres (Feb. 27th, 1594). The manifestations of loyalty increased.</p>
<p>On the evening of the day on which Henry had been received into the Roman
      Catholic Church at Saint Denis, he had recklessly ridden up to the
      crest of the height of Montmartre and looked down on Paris, which was
      still in the hands of the League. The feelings of the Parisians were
      also changing. The League was seamed with dissensions; Mayenne had
      quarrelled with the
      &ldquo;Sixteen,&rdquo; and the partisans of these fanatics of the League had street
      brawls with the citizens of more moderate opinions. <i>Parlement</i> took
      courage and denounced the presence of Spanish soldiers within the capital.
      The loyalists opened the way for the royal troops, Henry entered Paris
      (March 22nd), and marched to Notre Dame, where the clergy chanted the <i>Te
      Deum</i>. From the cathedral he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg
      221]</a></span> rode to the Louvre through streets thronged with people,
      who pressed up to his very stirrups to see their King, and made the
      tall houses re-echo with their loyalist shoutings. Such a royal entry
      had not been seen for generations, and took everyone by surprise. Next
      day the foreign troops left the city. The King watched their departure
      from an open window in the Louvre, and as their chiefs passed he called
      out gaily, &ldquo;My compliments to your Master. You need not come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the return of Paris to fealty, almost all signs of disaffection departed;
      and the King&rsquo;s proclamation of amnesty for all past rebellions completed
      the conquest of his people. France was again united after thirty years
      of civil war.</p>
<h3>&sect; 22. <i>The Edict of Nantes.</i></h3>
<p>The union of all Frenchmen to accept Henry <span class="smcap">IV.</span> as
      their King had not changed the legal position of the Protestants. The
      laws against them were still in force; they had nothing but the King&rsquo;s
      word promising protection to trust to. The war with Spain delayed matters,
      but when peace was made the time came for Henry to fulfil his pledges
      to his former companions. They had been chafing under the delay. At
      a General Assembly held at Mantes (October 1593-January 1594), the
      members had renewed their oath to live and to die true to their confession
      of faith, and year by year a General Assembly met to discuss their
      political disabilities as well as to conduct their ecclesiastical business.
      They had divided France into nine divisions under provincial synods,
      and had the appearance to men of that century of a kingdom within a
      kingdom. They demanded equal civic rights with their Roman Catholic
      fellow-subjects, and guarantees for their protection. At length, in
      1597, four delegates were appointed with full powers to confer with
      the King. Out of these negotiations came the Edict of Nantes, the Charter
      of French Protestantism.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></p>
<p>This celebrated edict was drawn up in ninety-five more general articles,
      which were signed on April 13th, and in fifty-six more particular articles
      which were signed on May 2nd (1598). Two <i>Brevets</i>, dated 13th
      and 30th of April, were added, dealing with the treatment of Protestant
      ministers, and with the strongholds given to the Protestants. The Articles
      were verified and registered by <i>Parlements</i>; the <i>Brevets</i> were
      guaranteed simply by the King&rsquo;s word.</p>
<p>The Edict of Nantes codified and enlarged the rights given to the Protestants
      of France by the Edict of Poitiers (1577), the Convention of N&eacute;rac
      (1578), the treaty of Fleix (1580), the Declaration of Saint-Cloud
      (1589), the Edict of Mantes (1591), the Articles of Mantes (1593),
      and the Edict of Saint-Germain (1594).</p>
<p>It secured complete liberty of conscience everywhere within the realm,
      to the extent that no one was to be persecuted or molested in any way
      because of his religion, nor be compelled to do anything contrary to
      its tenets; and this carried with it the right of private or secret
      worship. The full and free right of public worship was granted in all
      places in which it existed during the years 1596 and 1597, or where
      it had been granted by the Edict of Poitiers interpreted by the Convention
      of N&eacute;rac and the treaty of Fleix (some two hundred towns); and,
      in addition, in two places within every <i>bailliage</i> and <i>s&eacute;n&eacute;chauss&eacute;e</i> in
      the realm. It was also permitted in the principal castles of Protestant <i>seigneurs
      hauts justiciers</i> (some three thousand), whether the proprietor
      was in residence or not, and in their other castles, the proprietor
      being in residence; to nobles who were not <i>hauts justiciers</i>,
      provided the audience did not consist of more than thirty persons over
      and above relations of the family. Even at the Court the high officers
      of the Crown, the great nobles, all governors and lieutenants-general,
      and captains of the guards, had the liberty of worship in their apartments
      provided the doors were kept shut and there was no loud singing of
      psalms, noise, or open scandal.</p>
<p>Protestants were granted full civil rights and protection,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg
                  223]</a></span> entry into all universities, schools, and
                  hospitals, and admission to all public offices. The <i>Parlement</i> of
                  Paris admitted six Protestant councillors. And Protestant
                  ministers were granted the exemptions from military service
                  and such charges as the Romanist clergy enjoyed. Special
                  Chambers (<i>Chambres d&rsquo;&Eacute;dit</i>) were established
                  in the <i>Parlements</i> to try cases in which Protestants
                  were interested. In the <i>Parlement</i> of Paris this
                  Chamber consisted of six specially chosen Roman Catholics
                  and one Protestant; in other <i>Parlements</i>, the Chambers
                  were composed of equal numbers of Romanists and Protestants
                  (<i>mi-parties</i>). The Protestants were permitted to
                  hold their ecclesiastical assemblies&mdash;consistories,
                  colloquies, and synods, national and provincial; they were
                  even allowed to meet to discuss political questions, provided
                  they first secured the permission of the King.</p>
<p>They remained in complete control of two hundred towns, including La Rochelle,
      Montauban, and Montpellier, strongholds of exceptional strength. They
      were to retain these places until 1607, but the right was prolonged
      for five years more. The State paid the expenses of the troops which
      garrisoned these Protestant fortified places; it paid the governors,
      who were always Protestants. When it is remembered that the royal army
      in time of peace did not exceed ten thousand men, and that the Huguenots
      could raise twenty-five thousand troops, it will be seen that Henry <span class="smcap">IV.</span> did
      his utmost to provide guarantees against a return to a reign of intolerance.</p>
<p>Protected in this way, the Huguenot Church of France speedily took a foremost
      place among the Protestant Churches of Europe. Theological colleges
      were established at Sedan, Montauban, and Saumur. Learning and piety
      flourished, and French theology was always a counterpoise to the narrow
      Reformed Scholastic of Switzerland and of Holland.</p>

<h3>&sect; 1. <i>The Political Situation.</i></h3>
<p>It was not until 1581 that the <i>United Provinces</i> took rank as a
      Protestant nation, notwithstanding the fact that the Netherlands furnished
      the first martyrs of the Reformation in the persons of Henry Voes and
      John Esch, Augustinian monks, who were burnt at Antwerp (July 31st,
      1523).</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;As they were led to the stake they cried with a loud voice that
            they were Christians; and when they were fastened to it, and
            the fire was kindled, they rehearsed the twelve articles of the
            Creed, and after that the hymn <i>Te Deum laudamus</i>, which
            each of them sang verse by verse alternately until the flames
            deprived them both of voice and life.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></p>
<p>The struggle for religious liberty, combined latterly with one for national
      independence from Spain, lasted therefore for almost sixty years.</p>
<p>When the lifelong duel between Charles the Bold of Burgundy and Louis <span class="smcap">XI.</span> of
      France ended with the death of the former on the battlefield under
      the walls of Nancy (January 4th, 1477), Louis was able to annex to
      France a large portion of the heterogeneous possessions of the Dukes
      of Burgundy, and Mary of Burgundy carried the remainder as her marriage
      portion (May 1477) to Maximilian of Austria, the future Emperor. Speaking
      roughly, and not quite accurately, those portions of the Burgundian
      lands which had been <i>fiefs</i> of France went to Louis, while Mary
      and Maximilian retained those which were <i>fiefs</i> of the Empire.
      The son of Maximilian and Mary, Philip the Handsome, married Juana
      (August 1496), the second daughter and ultimate heiress of Isabella
      and Ferdinand of Spain, and their son was Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span>,
      Emperor of Germany (b. February 24th, 1500), who inherited the Netherlands
      from his father and Spain from his mother, and thus linked the Netherlands
      to Spain. Philip died in 1506, leaving Charles, a boy of six years
      of age, the ruler of the Netherlands. His paternal aunt, Margaret,
      the daughter of the Emperor Maximilian, governed in the Netherlands
      during his minority, and, owing to Juana&rsquo;s illness (an illness ending
      in madness), mothered her brother&rsquo;s children. Margaret&rsquo;s regency ended
      in 1515, and the earlier history of the Reformation in the Netherlands
      belongs either to the period of the personal rule of Charles or to
      that of the Regents whom he appointed to act for him.</p>
<p>The land, a delta of great rivers liable to overflow their banks, or a
      coast-line on which the sea made continual encroachment, produced a
      people hardy, strenuous, and independent. Their struggles with nature
      had braced their faculties. Municipal life had struck its roots deeply
      into the soil of the Netherlands, and its cities could vie with those
      of Italy in industry and intelligence. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg
      226]</a></span> southern provinces were the home of the Trouv&egrave;res.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> Jan
      van-Ruysbroec, the most heart-searching of speculative Mystics, had
      been a curate of St. Gudule&rsquo;s in Brussels. His pupil, Gerard Groot,
      had founded the lay-community of the Brethren of the Common Lot for
      the purpose of spreading Christian education among the laity; and the
      schools and convents of the Brethren had spread through the Netherlands
      and central Germany. Thomas &agrave; Kempis, the author of the <i>Imitatio
      Christi</i>, had lived most of his long life of ninety years in a small
      convent at Zwolle, within the territories of Utrecht. Men who have
      been called &ldquo;Reformers before the Reformation,&rdquo; John Pupper of Goch
      and John Wessel, both belonged to the Netherlands. Art flourished there
      in the fifteenth century in the persons of Hubert and Jan van Eyck
      and of Hans Memling. The Chambers of Oratory (<i>Rederijkers</i>) to
      begin with probably unions for the performance of miracle plays or
      moralities, became confraternities not unlike the societies of <i>meisters&auml;nger</i> in
      Germany, and gradually acquired the character of literary associations,
      which diffused not merely culture, but also habits of independent thinking
      among the people.</p>
<p>Intellectual life had become less exuberant in the end of the fifteenth
      century; but the Netherlands, nevertheless, produced Alexander Hegius,
      the greatest educational reformer of his time, and Erasmus the prince
      of the Humanists. Nor can the influence of the Chambers of Oratory
      have died out, for they had a great effect on the Reformation movement.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>
<p>When Charles assumed the government of the Netherlands, he found himself
      at the head of a group of duchies, lordships, counties, and municipalities
      which had little appearance of a compact principality, and he applied
      himself, like other princes of his time in the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg
      227]</a></span> situation, to give them a unity both political and
      territorial. He was so successful that he was able to hand over to
      his son, Philip <span class="smcap">II.</span> of Spain, an almost
      thoroughly organised State. The divisions which Charles largely overcame
      reappeared to some extent in the revolt against Philip and Romanism,
      and therefore in a measure concern the history of the Reformation.
      How Charles made his scattered Netherland inheritance territorially
      compact need not be told in detail. Friesland was secured (1515); the
      acquisition of temporal sovereignty over the ecclesiastical province
      of Utrecht (1527) united Holland with Friesland; Gronningen and the
      lands ruled by that turbulent city placed themselves under the government
      of Charles (1536); and the death of Charles of Egmont (1538), Count
      of Gueldres, completed the unification of the northern and central
      districts. The vague hold which France kept in some of the southern
      portions of the country was gradually loosened. Charles failed in the
      south-east. The independent principality of Lorraine lay between Luxemburg
      and Franche-Comt&eacute;, and the Netherland Government could not seize
      it by purchase, treaty, or conquest. One and the same system of law
      regulated the rights and the duties of the whole population; and all
      the provinces were united into one principality by the reorganisation
      of a States General, which met almost annually, and which had a real
      if vaguely defined power to regulate the taxation of the country.</p>
<p>But although political and geographical difficulties might be more or
      less overcome, others remained which were not so easily disposed of.
      One set arose from the fact that the seventeen provinces were divided
      by race and by language. The Dutchmen in the north were different in
      interests and in sentiment from the Flemings in the centre; and both
      had little in common with the French-speaking provinces in the south.
      The other was due to the differing boundaries of the ecclesiastical
      and civil jurisdictions. When Charles began to rule in 1515, the only
      territorial see was Arras. Tournai, Utrecht,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg
      228]</a></span> and Cambrai became territorial before the abdication
      of Charles. But the confusion between civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction
      may be seen at a glance when it is remembered that a great part of
      the Frisian lands were subject to the German Sees of M&uuml;nster,
      Minden, Paderborn, and Osnabr&uuml;ck; and that no less than six bishops,
      none of them belonging to the Netherlands, divided the ecclesiastical
      rule over Luxemburg. Charles&rsquo; proposals to establish six new bishoprics,
      plans invariably thwarted by the Roman Curia, were meant to give the
      Low Countries a national episcopate.</p>
<h3>&sect; 2. <i>The Beginnings of the Reformation.</i></h3>
<p>The people of the Netherlands had been singularly prepared for the great
      religious revival of the sixteenth century by the work of the <i>Brethren
      of the Common Lot</i> and their schools. It was the aim of Gerard Groot,
      their founder, and also of Florentius Radevynszoon, his great educational
      assistant, to see &ldquo;that the root of study and the mirror of life must,
      in the first place, be the Gospel of Christ.&rdquo; Their pupils were taught
      to read the Bible in Latin, and the Brethren contended publicly for
      translations of the Scriptures in the vulgar tongues. There is evidence
      to show that the Vulgate was well known in the Netherlands in the end
      of the fifteenth century, and a translation of the Bible into Dutch
      was published at Delft in 1477<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>.
      Small tracts against Indulgences, founded probably on the reasonings
      of Pupper and Wessel, had been in circulation before Luther had nailed
      his <i>Theses</i> to the door of All Saints&rsquo; church in Wittenberg.
      Hendrik of Zutphen, Prior of the Augustinian Eremite convent at Antwerp,
      had been a pupil of Staupitz, a fellow student with Luther, and had
      spread Evangelical teaching not only among his order, but throughout
      the town.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> It
      need be no matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg
      229]</a></span> for surprise, then, that Luther&rsquo;s writings were widely
      circulated in the Netherlands, and that between 1513 and 1531 no fewer
      than twenty-five translations of the Bible or of the New Testament
      had appeared in Dutch, Flemish, and French.</p>
<p>When Aleander was in the Netherlands, before attending the Diet of Worms
      he secured the burning of eighty Lutheran and other books at Louvain;<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> and
      when he came back ten months later, he had regular literary <i>auto-da-f&eacute;s</i>.
      On Charles&rsquo; return from the Diet of Worms, he issued a proclamation
      to all his subjects in the Netherlands against Luther, his books and
      his followers, and Aleander made full use of the powers it gave. Four
      hundred Lutheran books were burnt at Antwerp, three hundred of them
      seized by the police in the stalls of the booksellers, and one hundred
      handed over by the owners; three hundred were burnt at Ghent, &ldquo;part
      of them printed here and part in Germany,&rdquo; says the Legate; and he
      adds that &ldquo;many of them were very well bound, and one gorgeously in
      velvet.&rdquo; About a month later he is forced to confess that these burnings
      had not made as much impression as he had hoped, and that he wishes
      the Emperor would &ldquo;burn alive half a dozen Lutherans and confiscate
      their property.&rdquo; Such a proceeding would make all see him to be the
      really Christian prince that he is.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>
<p>Next year (1522) Charles established the Inquisition within the seventeen
      provinces. It was a distinctively civil institution, and this was perhaps
      due to the fact that there was little correspondence between the civil
      and ecclesiastical jurisdictions in the Netherlands; but it must not
      be forgotten that the Kings of Spain had used the Holy Office for the
      purpose of stamping out political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg
      230]</a></span> and local opposition, and also that the civil courts
      were usually more energetic and more severe than the ecclesiastical.
      The man appointed was unworthy of any place of important trust. Francis
      van de Hulst, although he had been the Prince&rsquo;s counsellor in Brabant,
      was a man accused both of bigamy and murder, and was hopelessly devoid
      of tact. He quarrelled violently with the High Court of Holland; and
      the Regent, Margaret of Austria, who had resumed her functions, found
      herself constantly compromised by his continual defiance of local privileges.
      He was a &ldquo;wonderful enemy to learning,&rdquo; says Erasmus. His colleague,
      Nicolas van Egmont, a Carmelite monk, is described by the same scholar
      as &ldquo;a madman with a sword put into his hand who hates me worse than
      he does Luther.&rdquo; The two men discredited the Inquisition from its beginning.
      Erasmus affected to believe that the Emperor could not know what they
      were doing.</p>
<p>The first victim was Cornelius Graph&aelig;us, town clerk of Antwerp,
      a poet and Humanist, a friend of Erasmus; and his offence was that
      he had published an edition of John Pupper of Goch&rsquo;s book, entitled
      the <i>Liberty of the Christian Religion</i>, with a preface of his
      own. The unfortunate man was set on a scaffold in Brussels, compelled
      to retract certain propositions which were said to be contained in
      the preface, and obliged to throw the preface itself into a fire kindled
      on the scaffold for the purpose. He was dismissed from his office,
      declared incapable of receiving any other employment, compelled to
      repeat his recantation at Antwerp, imprisoned for two years, and finally
      banished.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>
<p>The earliest deaths were those of Henry Voes and John Esch, who have already
      been mentioned. Their Prior, Hendrik of Zutphen, escaped from the dungeon
      in which he had been confined. Luther commemorated them in a long hymn,
      entitled <i>A New Song of the two</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg

<p>Charles issued proclamation after proclamation, each of increasing severity.
      It was forbidden to print any books unless they had been first examined
      and approved by the censors (April 1st, 1524). &ldquo;All open and secret
      meetings in order to read and preach the Gospel, the Epistles of St.
      Paul, and other spiritual writings,&rdquo; were forbidden (Sept. 25th, 1525),
      as also to discuss the Holy Faith, the Sacraments, the Power of the
      Pope and Councils, &ldquo;in private houses and at meals.&rdquo; This was repeated
      on March 14th, 1526, and on July 17th there was issued a long edict,
      said to have been carefully drafted by the Emperor himself, forbidding
      all meetings to read or preach about the Gospel or other holy writings
      in Latin, Flemish, or Walloon. In the preamble it is said that ignorant
      persons have begun to expound Scripture, that even regular and secular
      clergy have presumed to teach the &ldquo;errors and sinister doctrines of
      Luther and his adherents,&rdquo; and that heresies are increasing in the
      land. Then followed edicts against unlicensed books, and against monks
      who had left their cloisters (Jan. 28th, 1528); against the possession
      of Lutheran books, commanding them upon pain of death to be delivered
      up (Oct. 14th, 1529); against printing unlicensed books&mdash;the penalties
      being a public whipping on the scaffold, branding with a red-iron,
      or the loss of an eye or a hand, at the discretion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg
      232]</a></span> of the judge (Dec. 7th, 1530); against heretics &ldquo;who
      are more numerous than ever,&rdquo; against certain books of which a long
      list is given, and against certain hymns which increase the zeal of
      the heretics (Sept. 22nd, 1540); against printing and distributing
      unlicensed books in the Italian, Spanish, or English languages (Dec.
      18th, 1544); warning all schoolmasters about the use of unlicensed
      books in their schools, and giving a list of those only which are permitted
      (July 31st, 1546). The edict of 1546 was followed by a long list of
      prohibited books, among which are eleven editions of the Vulgate printed
      by Protestant firms, six editions of the Bible and three of the New
      Testament in Dutch, two editions of the Bible in French, and many others.
      Lastly, an edict of April 29th, 1550, confirmed all the previous edicts
      against heresy and its spread, and intimated that the Inquisitors would
      proceed against heretics &ldquo;notwithstanding any privileges to the contrary,
      which are abrogated and annulled by this edict.&rdquo; This was a clear threat
      that the terrible Spanish Inquisition was to be established in the
      Netherlands, and provoked such remonstrances that the edict was modified
      twice (Sept. 25th, Nov. 5th) before it was finally accepted as legal
      within the seventeen provinces.</p>
<p>All these edicts were directed against the Lutheran or kindred teaching.
      They had nothing to do with the Anabaptist movement, which called forth
      a special and different set of edicts. It seems against all evidence
      to say that the persecution of the Lutherans had almost ceased during
      the last years of Charles&rsquo; rule in the Netherlands, and Philip <span class="smcap">II.</span> could
      declare with almost perfect truth that his edicts were only his father&rsquo;s
      re-issued.</p>
<p>The continuous repetition and increasing severity of the edicts revealed
      not merely that persecution did not hinder the spread of the Reformed
      faith, but that the edicts themselves were found difficult to enforce.
      What Charles would have done had he been able to govern the country
      himself it is impossible to say. He became harder and more intolerant
      of differences in matters of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg
      233]</a></span> doctrine as years went on, and in his latest days is
      said to have regretted that he had allowed Luther to leave Worms alive;
      and he might have dealt with the Protestants of the seventeen provinces
      as his son afterwards did. His aunt, Margaret of Austria, who was Regent
      till 1530, had no desire to drive matters to an extremity; and his
      sister Mary, who ruled from 1530 till the abdication of Charles in
      1555, was suspected in early life of being a Lutheran herself. She
      never openly joined the Lutheran Church as did her sister the Queen
      of Denmark, but she confessed her sympathies to Charles, and gave them
      as a reason for reluctance to undertake the regency of the Netherlands.
      It may therefore be presumed that the severe edicts were not enforced
      with undue stringency by either Margaret of Austria or by the widowed
      Queen of Hungary. There is also evidence to show that these proclamations
      denouncing and menacing the unfortunate Protestants of the Netherlands
      were not looked on with much favour by large sections of the population.
      Officials were dilatory, magistrates were known to have warned suspected
      persons to escape before the police came to arrest them; even to have
      given them facilities for escape after sentence had been delivered.
      Passive resistance on the part of the inferior authorities frequently
      interposed itself between the Emperor and the execution of his bloodthirsty
      proclamations. Yet the number of Protestant martyrs was large, and
      women as well as men suffered torture and death rather than deny their
      faith.</p>
<p>The edicts against conventicles deterred neither preachers nor audience.
      The earliest missioners were priests and monks who had become convinced
      of the errors of Romanism. Later, preachers were trained in the south
      German cities and in Geneva, that nursery of daring agents of the Reformed
      propaganda. But if trained teachers were lacking, members of the congregation
      took their place at the peril of their lives. Brandt relates how numbers
      of people were accustomed to meet for service in a shipwright&rsquo;s yard
      at Antwerp to hear a monk who had been &ldquo;proclaimed&rdquo;:</p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;The teacher, by some chance or other, could not appear, and one of the
      company named Nicolas, a person well versed in Scripture, thought it
      a shame that such a congregation, hungering after the food of the Word,
      should depart without a little spiritual nourishment; wherefore, climbing
      the mast of a ship, he taught the people according to his capacity;
      and on that account, and for the sake of the reward that was set upon
      the preacher, he was seized by two butchers and delivered to the magistrates,
      who caused him to be put into a sack and thrown into the river, where
      he was drowned.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>
<h3>&sect; 3. <i>The Anabaptists.</i></h3>
<p>The severest persecutions, however, before the rule of Philip <span class="smcap">II.</span>,
      were reserved for those people who are called the Anabaptists.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> We
      find several edicts directed against them solely. In February 1532
      it was forbidden to harbour Anabaptists, and a price of 12 guilders
      was offered to informants. Later in the same year an edict was published
      which declared &ldquo;that all who had been rebaptized, were sorry for their
      fault, and, in token of their repentance, had gone to confession, would
      be admitted to mercy for that time only, provided they brought a certificate
      from their confessor within twenty-four days of the date of the edict;
      those who continued obdurate were to be treated with the utmost rigour
      of the laws&rdquo; (Feb. 1533). Anabaptists who had abjured were ordered
      to remain near their dwelling-places for the space of a year, &ldquo;unless
      those who were engaged in the herring fishery&rdquo; (June 1534). In 1535
      the severest edict against the sect was published.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg
      235]</a></span> All who had &ldquo;seduced or perverted any to this sect,
      or had rebaptized them,&rdquo; were to suffer death by fire; all who had
      suffered themselves to be rebaptized, or who had harboured Anabaptists,
      and who recanted, were to be favoured by being put to death by the
      sword; women were &ldquo;only to be buried alive.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>
<p>To understand sympathetically that multiform movement which was called
      in the sixteenth century <i>Anabaptism</i>, it is necessary to remember
      that it was not created by the Reformation, although it certainly received
      an impetus from the inspiration of the age. Its roots can be traced
      back for some centuries, and its pedigree has at least two stems which
      are essentially distinct, and were only occasionally combined. The
      one stem is the successions of the <i>Brethren</i>, a medi&aelig;val,
      anti-clerical body of Christians whose history is written only in the
      records of Inquisitors of the medi&aelig;val Church, where they appear
      under a variety of names, but are universally said to prize the Scriptures
      and to accept the Apostles&rsquo; Creed.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> The
      other existed in the continuous uprisings of the poor&mdash;peasants
      in rural districts and the lower classes in the towns&mdash;against
      the rich, which were a feature of the later Middle Ages.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>
<p>So far as the Netherlands are concerned, these popular outbreaks had been
      much more frequent among the towns&rsquo; population than in the rural districts.
      The city patriciate ordinarily controlled the magistracy; but when
      flagrant cases of oppression arose, all the judicial, financial, and
      other functions of government were sure to be swept out of their hands
      in an outburst of popular fury. So much was this the case, that the
      real holders of power in the towns in the Netherlands during the first
      half of the sixteenth century were the artisans, strong in their trade
      organisations. They had long known their power, and had been accustomed
      to exert it. The blood of a turbulent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg
      236]</a></span> ancestry ran in their veins&mdash;of men who could
      endure for a time, but who, when roused by serious oppression, had
      been accustomed to defend themselves, and to give stroke for stroke.
      It is only natural to find among the artisans of the Flemish and Dutch
      towns a curious mingling of sublime self-sacrifice for what they believed
      to be the truth, of the mystical exaltation of the martyr occasionally
      breaking out in hysterical action, and the habit of defending themselves
      against almost any odds.</p>
<p>So far as is known, the earliest Anabaptist martyrs were Jan Walen and
      two others belonging to Waterlandt. They were done to death in a peculiarly
      atrocious way at The Hague in 1527. Instead of being burnt alive, they
      were chained to a stake at some distance from a huge fire, and were
      slowly roasted to death. This frightful punishment seems to have been
      reserved for the Anabaptist martyrs. It was repeated at Haarlem in
      1532, when a woman was drowned and her husband with two others was
      roasted alive. Some time in 1530, Jan Volkertz founded an Anabaptist
      congregation in Amsterdam which became so large as to attract the attention
      of the authorities. The head of the police (<i>schout</i>) in the city
      was ordered to apprehend them. Volkertz delivered himself up voluntarily.
      The greater part of the accused received timely warning from the <i>schout&rsquo;s</i> wife.
      Nine were taken by night in their beds. These with their pastor were
      carried to The Hague and beheaded by express order of the Emperor.
      He also commanded that their heads should be sent to Amsterdam, where
      they were set on poles in a circle, the head of Volkertz being in the
      centre. This ghastly spectacle was so placed that it could be seen
      from the ships entering and leaving the harbour. All these martyrs,
      and many others whose deaths are duly recorded, were followers of Melchior
      Hoffman. Hoffman&rsquo;s views were those of the &ldquo;Brethren&rdquo; of the later
      Middle Ages, the <i>Old Evangelicals</i> as they were called. In a
      paper of directions sent to Emden to assist in the organisation of
      an Anabaptist congregation there, he says:</p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s community knows no head but Christ. No other can be endured,
            for it is a brother- and sisterhood. The teachers have none who
            rule them spiritually but Christ. Teachers and ministers are
            not lords. The pastors have no authority except to preach God&rsquo;s
            Word and punish sins. A bishop must be elected out of his community.
            Where a pastor has thus been taken, and the guidance committed
            to him and to his deacon, a community should provide properly
            for those who help to build the Lord&rsquo;s house. When teachers are
            thus found, there is no fear that the communities will suffer
            spiritual hunger. A true preacher would willingly see the whole
            community prophesy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the persecution, with its peculiar atrocities, had been acting in
      its usual way on the Anabaptists of the Netherlands. They had been
      tortured on the rack, scourged, imprisoned in dungeons, roasted to
      death before slow fires, and had seen their women drowned, buried alive,
      pressed into coffins too small for their bodies till their ribs were
      broken, others stamped into them by the feet of the executioners. It
      is to be wondered at that those who stood firm sometimes gave way to
      hysterical excesses; that their leaders began to preach another creed
      than that of passive resistance; that wild apocalyptic visions were
      reported and believed?</p>
<p>Melchior Hoffman had been imprisoned in Strassburg in 1533, and a new
      leader arose in the Netherlands&mdash;Jan Matthys, a baker of Haarlem.
      Under his guidance an energetic propaganda was carried on in the Dutch
      towns, and hundreds of converts were made. One hundred persons were
      baptized in one day in February (1534); before the end of March it
      was reported that two-thirds of the population in Monnikendam were
      Anabaptists; and a similar state of matters existed in many of the
      larger Dutch towns. Deventer, Zwolle, and Kampen were almost wholly
      Anabaptist. The Government made great exertions to crush the movement.
      Detachments of soldiers were divided into bands of fifteen or twenty,
      and patrolled the environs of the cities, making midnight visitations,
      and haling men and women to prison until the dungeons were overcrowded
      with captured Anabaptists.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></p>
<p>Attempts were made by the persecuted to leave the country for some more
      hospitable place where they could worship God in peace in the way their
      consciences directed them. East Friesland had once been a haven, but
      was so no longer. M&uuml;nster offered a refuge. Ships were chartered,&mdash;thirty
      of them,&mdash;and the persecuted people proposed to sail round the
      north of Friesland, land at the mouth of the Ems, and travel to M&uuml;nster
      by land.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> The
      Emperor&rsquo;s ships intercepted the little fleet, sank five of the vessels
      with all the emigrants on board, and compelled the rest to return.
      The leaders found on board were decapitated, and their heads stuck
      on poles to warn others. Hundreds from the provinces of Guelderland
      and Holland attempted the journey by land. They piled their bits of
      poor furniture and bundles of clothes on waggons; some rode horses,
      most trudged on foot, the women and children, let us hope, getting
      an occasional ride on the waggons. Soldiers were sent to intercept
      them. The leaders were beheaded, the men mostly imprisoned, and the
      women and children sent back to their towns and villages.</p>
<p>Then, and not till they had exhausted every method of passive resistance,
      the Anabaptists began to strike back. They wished to seize a town already
      containing a large Anabaptist population, and hold it as a city of
      refuge. Deventer, which was full of sympathisers, was their first aim.
      The plot failed, and the burgomaster&rsquo;s son Willem, one of the conspirators,
      was seized, and with two companions beheaded in the market-place (Dec.
      25th, 1534). Their next attempt was on Leyden. It was called a plot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg
      239]</a></span> to burn the town. The magistrates got word of it, and,
      by ordering the great town-clock to be stopped, disconcerted the plotters.
      Fifteen men and five women were seized; the men were decapitated, and
      the women drowned (Jan. 1535). Next month (Feb. 28th, 1535), Jan van
      Geelen, leading a band of three hundred refugees through Friesland,
      was overtaken by some troops of soldiers. The little company entrenched
      themselves, fought bravely for some days, until nearly all were killed.
      The survivors were almost all captured and put to death, the men by
      the sword, and the women by drowning. One hundred soldiers fell in
      the attack. A few months later (May 1535), an attempt was made to seize
      Amsterdam. It was headed by van Geelen, the only survivor of the skirmish
      in Friesland. He and his companions were able to get possession of
      the Stadthaus, and held it against the town&rsquo;s forces until cannon were
      brought to batter down their defences.</p>
<p>In the early days of the same year an incident occurred which shows how,
      under the strain of persecution, an hysterical exaltation took possession
      of some of these poor people. It is variously reported. According to
      Brandt, seven men and five women having stript off their clothes, as
      a sign, they said, that they spoke the naked truth, ran through the
      streets of Amsterdam, crying <i>Woe! Woe! Woe!</i> The Wrath of God!
      They were apprehended, and slaughtered in the usual way. The woman
      in whose house they had met was hanged at her own door.</p>
<p>The insurrections were made the pretext for still fiercer persecutions.
      The Anabaptists were hunted out, tortured and slain without any attempt
      being made by the authorities to discriminate between those who had
      and those who had not been sharers in any insurrectionary attempt.
      It is alleged that over thirty thousand people were put to death in
      the Netherlands during the reign of Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span> Many
      of the victims had no connection with Anabaptism whatsoever; they were
      quiet followers of Luther or of Calvin. The authorities discriminated
      between them in their proclamations, but not in the persecution.</p>

<h3>&sect; 4. <i>Philip of Spain and the Netherlands.</i></h3>
<p>How long the Netherlands would have stood the continual drain of money
      and the severity of the persecution which the foreign and religious
      policy of Charles enforced upon them, it is impossible to say. The
      people of the country were strongly attached to him, as he was to them.
      He had been born and had grown from childhood to manhood among them.
      Their languages, French and Flemish, were the only speech he could
      ever use with ease. He had been ruler in the Netherlands before he
      became King of Spain, and long before he was called to fill the imperial
      throne. When he resolved to act on his long meditated scheme of abdicating
      in favour of his son Philip, it was to the Netherlands that he came.
      Their nobles and people witnessed the scene with hardly less emotion
      than that which showed itself in the faltering speech of the Emperor.</p>
<p>The ceremony took place in the great Hall of the palace in Brussels (Oct.
      25th, 1555), in presence of the delegates of the seventeen provinces.
      Mary, the widowed Queen of Hungary, who had governed the land for twenty-five
      years, witnessed the scene which was to end her rule. Philip, who was
      to ruin the work of consolidation patiently planned and executed by
      his father and his aunt, was present, summoned from his uncongenial
      task of eating roast beef and drinking English ale in order to conciliate
      his new subjects across the Channel, and from the embarrassing endearments
      of his elderly spouse. The Emperor, aged by toil rather than by years,
      entered the Hall leaning heavily on his favourite page and trusty counsellor,
      the youthful William, Prince of Orange, who was to become the leader
      of the revolt against Philip&rsquo;s rule, and to create a new Protestant
      State, the United Provinces.</p>
<p>The new lord of the Netherlands was then twenty-eight. In outward appearance
      he was a German like his father, but in speech he was a Spaniard. He
      had none of his father&rsquo;s external geniality, and could never stoop
      to win men to his ends. But Philip <span class="smcap">II.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg
      241]</a></span> was much liker Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span> than
      many historians seem willing to admit. Both had the same slow, patient
      industry&mdash;but in the son it was slower; the same cynical distrust
      of all men; the same belief in the divine selection of the head of
      the House of Hapsburg to guide all things in State and Church irrespective
      of Popes or Kings&mdash;only in the son it amounted to a sort of gloomy
      mystical assurance; the same callousness to human suffering, and the
      same utter inability to comprehend the force of strong religious conviction.
      Philip was an inferior edition of his father, succeeding to his father&rsquo;s
      ideas, pursuing the same policy, using the same methods, but handicapped
      by the fact that he had not originated but had inherited both, and
      with them the troubles brought in their train.</p>
<p>Philip <span class="smcap">II.</span> spent the first four years of his
      reign in the Netherlands, and during that short period of personal
      rule his policy had brought into being all the more important sources
      of dissatisfaction which ended in the revolt. Yet his policy was the
      same, and his methods were not different from those of his father.
      In one respect at least Charles had never spared the Netherlands. That
      country had to pay, as no other part of his vast possessions was asked
      to do, the price of his foreign policy, and Charles had wrung unexampled
      sums from his people.</p>
<p>When Philip summoned the States General (March 12th, 1556) and asked them
      for a very large grant (Fl. 1,300,000), he was only following his father&rsquo;s
      example, and on that occasion was seeking money to liquidate the deficit
      which his father had bequeathed. Was it that the people of the Netherlands
      had resolved to end the practice of making them pay for a foreign policy
      which had hitherto concerned them little, or was it because they could
      not endure the young Spaniard who could not speak to them in their
      own language? Would Charles have been refused as well as Philip? Who
      can say?</p>
<p>When Philip obtained a Bull from Pope Paul <span class="smcap">IV.</span> for
      creating a territorial episcopate in the Netherlands, he was only carrying
      out the policy which his father had sketched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg
      242]</a></span> as early as 1522, and which but for the shortness of
      the pontificate of Hadrian <span class="smcap">VI.</span> would undoubtedly
      have been executed in 1524 without any popular opposition. Charles&rsquo;
      scheme contemplated six bishoprics, Philip&rsquo;s fourteen; that was the
      sole difference; and from the ecclesiastical point of view Philip&rsquo;s
      was probably the better. Why then the bitter opposition to the change
      in 1557? Most historians seem to think that had Charles been ruling,
      there would have been few murmurs. Is that so certain? The people feared
      the institution of the bishoprics, because they dreaded and hated an
      Inquisition which would override their local laws, rights, and privileges;
      and Charles had been obliged to modify his &ldquo;Placard&rdquo; of 1549 against
      heresy, because towns and districts protested so loudly against it.
      During these early years Philip made no alterations on his father&rsquo;s
      proclamations against heresy. He contented himself with reissuing the &ldquo;Placard&rdquo; of
      1549 as that had been amended in 1550 after the popular protests. The
      personality of Philip was no doubt objectionable to his subjects in
      the Netherlands, but it cannot be certainly affirmed that had Charles
      continued to reign there would have been no widespread revolt against
      his financial, ecclesiastical, and religious policy. The Regent Mary
      had been finding her task of ruling more and more difficult. A few
      weeks before the abdication, when the Emperor wished his sister to
      continue in the Regency, she wrote to him:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;I could not live among these people even as a private citizen,
            for it would be impossible to do my duty towards God and my Prince.
            As to governing them, I take God to witness that the task is
            so abhorrent to me that I would rather earn my daily bread by
            labour than attempt it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1559 (Aug. 26th), Philip left the Netherlands never to return. He had
      selected Margaret of Parma, his half-sister, the illegitimate daughter
      of Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span>, for Regent. Margaret had
      been born and brought up in the country; she knew the language, and
      she had been so long away from her native land that she was not personally
      committed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg
      243]</a></span> any policy nor acquainted with the leaders of any of
      the parties.</p>
<p>The power of the Regent, nominally extensive, was in reality limited by
      secret instructions.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> She
      was ordered to put in execution the edicts against heresy without any
      modification; and she was directed to submit to the advice given her
      by three Councils, a command which placed her under the supervision
      of the three men selected by Philip to be the presidents of these Councils.
      The Council of State was the most important, and was entrusted with
      the management of the whole foreign and home administration of the
      country. It consisted of the Bishop of Arras (Antoine Perronet de Granvelle,
      afterwards Cardinal de Granvelle);<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> the
      Baron de Barlaymont, who was President of the Council of Finance; Vigilius
      van Aytta, a learned lawyer from Friesland, &ldquo;a small brisk man, with
      long yellow hair, glittering green eyes, fat round rosy cheeks, and
      flowing beard,&rdquo; who was President of the Privy Council, and controlled
      the administration of law and justice; and two of the Netherland nobles,
      Lamoral, Count of Egmont and Prince of Gavre, and William, Prince of
      Orange. The two nobles were seldom consulted or even invited to be
      present. The three Presidents were the <i>Consulta</i>, or secret body
      of confidential advisers imposed by Philip upon his Regent, without
      whose advice nothing was to be attempted. Of the three, the Bishop
      of Arras (Cardinal de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg
      244]</a></span> Granvelle) was the most important, and the government
      was practically placed in his hands by his master. Behind the <i>Consulta</i> was
      Philip <span class="smcap">II.</span> himself, who in his business
      room in the Escurial at Madrid issued his orders, repressing every
      tendency to treat the people with moderation and humanity, thrusting
      aside all suggestions of wise tolerance, and insisting that his own
      cold-blooded policy should be carried out in its most objectionable
      details. It was not until the publication of de Granvelle&rsquo;s State Papers
      and Correspondence that it came to be known how much the Bishop of
      Arras has been misjudged by history, how he remonstrated unavailingly
      with his master, how he was forced to put into execution a sanguinary
      policy of repression which was repugnant to himself, and how Philip
      compelled him to bear the obloquy of his own misdeeds. The correspondence
      also reveals the curiously minute information which Philip must have
      privately received, for he was able to send to the Regent and the Bishop
      the names, ages, personal appearance, occupations, residence of numbers
      of obscure people whom he ordered to execution for their religious
      opinions.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> No
      rigour of persecution seemed able to prevent the spread of the Reformation.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>
<p>The Government&mdash;Margaret and her <i>Consulta</i>&mdash;offended grievously
      not merely the people, but the nobility of the Netherlands. The nobles
      saw their services and positions treated as things of no consequence,
      and the people witnessed with alarm that the local charters and privileges
      of the land&mdash;charters and rights which Philip at his coronation
      had sworn to maintain&mdash;were totally disregarded. Gradually all
      classes of the population were united in a silent opposition. The Prince
      of Orange and Count Egmont became almost insensibly the leaders.</p>
<p>They had been dissatisfied with their position on the Council of State;
      they had no real share in the business; the correspondence was not
      submitted to them, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg
      245]</a></span> knew such details only as Granvelle chose to communicate
      to them. Their first overt act was to resign the commissions they held
      in the Spanish troops stationed in the country; their second, to write
      to the King asking him to relieve them of their position on the Council
      of State, telling him that matters of great importance were continually
      transacted without their knowledge or concurrence, and that in the
      circumstances they could not conscientiously continue to sustain the
      responsibilities of office.<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>
<p>The opposition took their stand on three things, all of which hung together&mdash;the
      presence of Spanish troops on the soil of the Netherlands, the cruelties
      perpetrated in the execution of the <i>Placards</i> against heresy,
      and the institution of the new bishoprics in accordance with the Bull
      of Pope Paul <span class="smcap">IV.</span>, reaffirmed by Pius <span class="smcap">IV.</span> in
      1560 (Jan.). The common fighting ground for the opposition to all the
      three was the invasion of the charters and privileges of the various
      provinces which these measures necessarily involved, and the consequent
      violation of the King&rsquo;s coronation oath.</p>
<p>Philip had solemnly promised to withdraw the Spanish troops within three
      or four months after he left the country. They had remained for fourteen,
      and the whole land cried out against the pillage and rapine which accompanied
      their presence. The people of Zeeland declared that they would rather
      see the ocean submerge their country&mdash;that they would rather perish,
      men, women, and children, in the waves&mdash;than endure longer the
      outrages which these mercenaries inflicted upon them. They refused
      to repair the Dykes. The presence of these troops had been early seen
      to be a degradation to his country by William of Orange.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> At
      the States General held on the eve of Philip&rsquo;s departure, he had urged
      the Assembly to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg
      246]</a></span> make the departure of the troops a condition of granting
      subsidies, and had roused Philip&rsquo;s wrath in consequence. He now voiced
      the cry of the whole country. It was so strong that Granvelle sent
      many an urgent request to the King to sanction their removal; and at
      length he and the Regent, without waiting for orders, had the troops
      embarked for Madrid.</p>
<p>The rigorous repression of heresy compelled the Government to override
      the charters of the several provinces. Many of these charters contained
      very strong provisions, and the King had sworn to maintain them. The
      constitution of Brabant, known as the <i>joyeuse entr&eacute;e</i> (<i>blyde
      inkomst</i>), provided that the clergy should not be given unusual
      powers; and that no subject, nor even a foreign resident, could be
      prosecuted civilly or criminally except in the ordinary courts of the
      land, where he could answer and defend himself with the help of advocates.
      The charter of Holland contained similar provisions. Both charters
      declared that if the Prince transgressed these provisions the subjects
      were freed from their allegiance. The inquisitorial courts violated
      the charters of those and of the other provinces. The great objection
      taken to the increase of the episcopate, according to the provisions
      of the Bulls of Paul <span class="smcap">IV.</span> and of Pius <span class="smcap">IV.</span>,
      was that it involved a still greater infringement of the chartered
      rights of the land. For example, the Bulls provided that the bishops
      were to appoint nine canons, who were to assist them in all inquisitorial
      cases, while at least one of them was to be an Inquisitor charged with
      ferreting out and punishing heresy. This was apparently their great
      charm for Philip <span class="smcap">II.</span> He desired an instrument
      to extirpate heretics. He knew that the Reformation was making great
      progress in the Netherlands, especially in the great commercial cities.
      &ldquo;I would lose all my States and a hundred lives if I had them,&rdquo; he
      wrote to the Pope, &ldquo;rather than be the lord of heretics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The opposition at first contented itself with protesting against the position
      and rule of Granvelle, and with demanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg
      247]</a></span> his recall. Philip came to the reluctant conclusion
      to dismiss his Minister, and did so with more than his usual duplicity.
      The nobles returned to the Council, and the Regent affected to take
      their advice. But they were soon to discover that the recall of the
      obnoxious Minister did not make any change in the policy of Philip.</p>
<p>The Regent read them a letter from Philip ordering the publication and
      enforcement of the Decrees of the Council of Trent in the Netherlands.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> The
      nobles protested vehemently on the ground that this would mean a still
      further invasion of the privileges of the provinces. After long deliberation,
      it was resolved to send Count Egmont to Madrid to lay the opinions
      of the Council before the King. The debate was renewed on the instructions
      to be given to the delegate. Those suggested by the President, Vigilius,
      were colourless. Then William the Silent spoke out. His speech, a long
      one, full of suppressed passionate sympathy with his persecuted fellow-countrymen,
      made an extraordinary impression. It is thus summarised by Brandt:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>That they ought to speak their minds freely; that there were such
            commotions and revolutions on account of religion in all the
            neighbouring countries, that it was impossible to maintain the
            present r&eacute;gime, and think to suppress disturbances by
            means of <i>Placards</i>, Inquisitions, and Bishops; that the
            King was mistaken if he proposed to maintain the Decrees of the
            Council of Trent in these Provinces which lay so near Germany,
            where all the Princes, Roman Catholics as well as Protestants,
            have justly rejected them; that it would be better that His Majesty
            should tolerate these things as other Princes were obliged to
            do, and annul or else moderate the punishments proclaimed in
            the <i>Placards</i>; that though he himself had resolved to adhere
            to the Catholic religion, yet he could not approve that Princes
            should aim at dominion over the souls of men, or deprive them
            of the freedom of their faith and religion.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></p>
<p>The instructions given to Egmont were accordingly both full and plain-spoken.</p>
<p>Count Egmont departed leisurely to Madrid, was well received by Philip,
      and left thoroughly deceived, perhaps self-deceived, about the King&rsquo;s
      intentions. He had a rude awakening when the sealed letter he bore
      was opened and read in the Council. It announced no real change in
      policy, and in the matter of heresy showed that the King&rsquo;s resolve
      was unaltered. A despatch to the Regent (Nov. 5th, 1565) was still
      more unbending. Philip would not enlarge the powers of the Council
      in the Netherlands; he peremptorily refused to summon the States General;
      and he ordered the immediate publication and enforcement of the Decrees
      of the Council of Trent in every town and village in the seventeen
      provinces. True to the policy of his house, the Decrees of Trent were
      to be proclaimed in <i>his</i> name, not in that of the Pope. It was
      the beginning of the tragedy, as William of Orange remarked.</p>
<p>The effect of the order was immediate and alarming. The Courts of Holland
      and Brabant maintained that the Decrees infringed their charters, and
      refused to permit their publication. Stadtholders and magistrates declared
      that they would rather resign office than execute decrees which would
      compel them to burn over sixty thousand of their fellow-countrymen.
      Trade ceased; industries died out; a blight fell on the land. Pamphlets
      full of passionate appeals to the people to put an end to the tyranny
      were distributed and eagerly read. In one of them, which took the form
      of a letter to the King, it was said:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;We are ready to die for the Gospel, but we read therein, &lsquo;Render
            unto C&aelig;sar the things which are C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s, and unto
            God the things that are God&rsquo;s.&rsquo; We thank God that even our enemies
            are constrained to bear witness to our piety and innocence, for
            it is a common saying: &lsquo;He does not swear, for he is a Protestant.
            He is not an immoral man, nor a drunkard, for he belongs to the
            new sect&rsquo;; yet we are subjected to every kind of punishment that
            can be invented to torment us.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></p>
<p>The year 1566 saw the origin of a new confederated opposition to Philip&rsquo;s
      mode of ruling the Netherlands. Francis Du Jon, a young Frenchman of
      noble birth, belonging to Bourges, had studied for the ministry at
      Geneva, and had been sent as a missioner to the Netherlands, where
      his learning and eloquence had made a deep impression on young men
      of the upper classes. His life was in constant peril, and he was compelled
      to flit secretly from the house of one sympathiser to that of another.
      During the festivities which accompanied the marriage of the young
      Alexander of Parma with Maria of Portugal, he was concealed in the
      house of the Count of Culemburg in Brussels. On the day of the wedding
      he preached and prayed with a small company of young nobles, twenty
      in all. There and at other meetings held afterwards it was resolved
      to form a confederacy of nobles, all of whom agreed to bind themselves
      to support principles laid down in a carefully drafted manifesto which
      went by the name of the <i>Compromise</i>. It was mainly directed against
      the Inquisition, which it calls a tribunal opposed to all laws, divine
      and human. Copies passed from hand to hand soon obtained over two thousand
      signatures among the lower nobility and landed gentry. Many substantial
      burghers also signed. The leading spirits in the confederacy were Louis
      of Nassau, the younger brother of the Prince of Orange, then a Lutheran;
      Philip de Marnix, lord of Sainte Aldegonde, a Calvinist; and Henry
      Viscount Brederode, a Roman Catholic. The confederates declared that
      they were loyal subjects; but pledged themselves to protect each other
      if any of them were attacked.</p>
<p>The confederates met privately at Breda and Hoogstraten (March 1566),
      and resolved to present a petition to the Regent asking that the King
      should be recommended to abolish the <i>Placards</i> and the Inquisition,
      and that the Regent should suspend their operation until the King&rsquo;s
      wishes were known; also that the States General should be assembled
      to consider other ordinances dangerous to the country. The Regent had
      called an assembly of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg
      250]</a></span> Notables for March 28th, and it was resolved to present
      the petition then. The confederation and its <i>Compromise</i> were
      rather dreaded by the great nobles who had been the leaders of the
      constitutional opposition, and there was some debate about the presentation
      of the <i>Request</i>. The Baron de Barlaymont went so far as to recommend
      a massacre of the petitioners in the audience hall; but wiser counsels
      prevailed. The confederates met and marshalled themselves,&mdash;two
      hundred young nobles,&mdash;and marched through the streets to the
      Palace, amid the acclamations of the populace, to present the <i>Request</i>.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> The
      Regent was somewhat dismayed by the imposing demonstration, but Barlaymont
      reassured her with the famous words:
      &ldquo;Madame, is your Highness afraid of these beggars (<i>ces gueux</i>)?&rdquo; The
      deputation was dismissed with fair words, and the promise that although
      the Regent had no power to suspend the <i>Placards</i> or the Inquisition,
      there would be some moderation used until the King&rsquo;s pleasure was known.</p>
<p>Before leaving Brussels, three hundred of the confederates met in the
      house of the Count of Culemburg to celebrate their league at a banquet.
      The Viscount de Brederode presided, and during the feast he recalled
      to their memories the words of Barlaymont: &ldquo;They call us beggars,&rdquo; he
      said; &ldquo;we accept the name. We pledge ourselves to resist the Inquisition,
      and keep true to the King and the beggar&rsquo;s wallet.&rdquo; He then produced
      the leathern sack of the wandering beggars, strapped it round his shoulder,
      and drank prosperity to the cause from a beggar&rsquo;s wooden bowl. The
      name and the emblem were adopted with enthusiasm, and spread far beyond
      the circle of the confederacy.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> Everywhere
      burghers, lawyers, peasants as well as nobles appeared wearing the
      beggar&rsquo;s sack. Medals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg
      251]</a></span> made first of wax set in a wooden cup, then of gold
      and silver, were adopted by the confederated nobles. On the one side
      was the effigies of the King, and on the obverse two hands clasped
      and the beggar&rsquo;s sack with the motto, <i>Fidelles au Roi jusques &agrave; porter
      la besace</i> (beggar&rsquo;s sack).</p>
<p>All these things were faithfully reported by the Regent to Philip, and
      she besought him either to permit her to moderate the <i>Placards</i> and
      the Inquisition, or to come to the Netherlands himself. He answered,
      promising to come, and permitted her some discretion in the matter
      of repression of heresy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the people were greatly encouraged by the success, or appearance
      of success, attending the efforts of the confederates. Refugees returned
      from France, Germany, and Switzerland. Missioners of the Reformed faith
      came in great numbers. Field-preachings were held all over the country.
      The men came armed, planted sentinels, placed their women and children
      within the square, and thus listened to the services conducted by the
      excommunicated ministers. They heard the Scriptures read and prayers
      poured forth in their own tongue. They sang hymns and psalms in French,
      Flemish, and Dutch. The crowds were so large, the sentinels so wary,
      the men so well armed, that the soldiers dared not attempt to disperse
      them. At first the meetings were held at night in woods and desolate
      places, but immunity created boldness.</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;On July 23rd (1566) the Reformed rendezvoused in great numbers
            in a large meadow not far from Ghent. There they formed a sort
            of camp, fortifying themselves with their waggons, and setting
            sentinels at all the roads. Some brought pikes, some hatchets,
            and others guns. In front of them were pedlars with prohibited
            books, which they sold to such as came. They planted several
            along the road whose business it was to invite people to come
            to the preaching and to show them the way. They made a kind of
            pulpit of planks, and set it upon a waggon, from which the minister
            preached. When the sermon was ended, all the congregation sang
            several psalms. They also drew water out of a well or brook near
            them, and a child was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg
            252]</a></span> baptized. Two days were spent there, and then
            they adjourned to Deinsen, then to Ekelo near Bruges, and so
            through all West Flanders.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Growing bolder still, the Reformed met in the environs and suburbs of
      the great towns. Bands of men marched through the streets singing Psalms,
      either the French versions of Clement Marot or B&egrave;ze or the Dutch
      one of Peter Dathenus. It was in vain that the Regent issued a new <i>Placard</i> against
      the preachers and the conventicles. It remained a dead letter. In Antwerp,
      bands of the Reformed, armed, crowded to the preachings in defiance
      of the magistrates, who were afraid of fighting in the streets. In
      the emergency the Regent appealed to William of Orange, and he with
      difficulty appeased the tumults and arranged a compromise. The Calvinists
      agreed to disarm on the condition that they were allowed the free exercise
      of their worship in the suburbs although not within the towns.<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>
<p>The confederates were so encouraged with their successes that they thought
      of attempting more. A great conference was held at St. Trond in the
      principality of Li&egrave;ge (July 1566), attended by nearly two thousand
      members. The leader was Louis of Nassau. They resolved on another deputation
      to the Regent, and twelve of their number were selected to present
      their demands. These &ldquo;Twelve Apostles,&rdquo; as the courtiers contemptuously
      termed them, declared that the persecution had not been mitigated as
      promised, and not obscurely threatened that if some remedy were not
      found they might be forced to invoke foreign assistance. The threat
      enraged the Regent; but she was helpless; she could only urge that
      she had already made representations to the King, and had sent two
      members of Council to inform the King about the condition of the country.</p>
<p>It seemed as if some impression had been made on Philip. The Regent received
      a despatch (July 31st, 1566)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg
      253]</a></span> saying that he was prepared to withdraw the papal Inquisition
      from the Netherlands, and that he would grant what toleration was consistent
      with the maintenance of the Catholic religion; only he would in no
      way consent to a summoning of the States General.</p>
<p>There was great triumphing in the Netherlands at this news. Perhaps every
      one but the Prince of Orange was more or less deceived by Philip&rsquo;s
      duplicity. It is only since the archives of Simancas have yielded their
      secrets that its depth has been known. They reveal that on Aug. 9th
      he executed a deed in which he declared that the promise of pardon
      had been won from him by force, and that he did not mean to keep it,
      and that on Aug. 12th he wrote to the Pope that his declaration to
      withdraw the Inquisition was a mere blind. William only knew that the
      King was levying troops, and that he was blaming the great nobles of
      the Netherlands for the check inflicted upon him by the confederates.</p>
<p>Long before Philip&rsquo;s real intentions were unmasked, a series of iconoclastic
      attacks not only gave the King the pretext he needed, but did more
      harm to the cause of the Reformation in the Low Countries than all
      the persecutions under Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span> and his
      son. The origin of these tumultuous proceedings is obscure. According
      to Brandt, who collects information from all sides:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;Some few of the vilest of the mob ... were those who began the
            dance, being hallooed on by nobody knows whom. Their arms were
            staves, hatchets, hammers, ladders, ropes, and other tools more
            proper to demolish than to fight with; some few were provided
            with guns and swords. At first they attacked the crosses and
            the images that had been erected on the great roads in the country;
            next, those in the villages; and, lastly, those in the towns
            and cities. All the chapels, churches, and convents which they
            found shut they forced open, breaking, tearing, and destroying
            all the images, pictures, shrines and other consecrated things
            they met with; nay, some did not scruple to lay their hands upon
            libraries, books, writings, monuments, and even on the dead bodies
            in churches and churchyards.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></p>
<p>According to almost all accounts, the epidemic, for the madness resembled
      a disease, first appeared at St. Omer (Aug. 14th, 1566), then at Ypres,
      and extended rapidly to other towns. It came to a height at Antwerp
      (16th and 17th Aug. 1566), when the mob sacked the great cathedral
      and destroyed some of its richest treasures.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> An
      eye-witness declared that the rioters in the cathedral did not number
      more than one hundred men, women, and boys, drawn from the dregs of
      the population, and that the attacks on the other churches were made
      by small parties of ten or twelve persons.</p>
<p>These outrages had a disastrous effect on the Reformation movement in
      the Netherlands, both immediately and in the future. They at once exasperated
      the more liberal-minded Roman Catholics and enraged the Regent: they
      began that gradual cleavage which ended in the separation of the Protestant
      North from the Romanist South. The Regent felt herself justified in
      practically withdrawing all the privileges she had accorded to the
      Reformed, and in raising German and Walloon troops to overawe the Protestants.
      The presence of these troops irritated some of the Calvinist nobles,
      and John de Marnix, elder brother of Sainte Aldegonde, attempted to
      seize the Island of Walcheren in order to hold it as a city of refuge
      for his persecuted brethren. He was unsuccessful; a fight took place
      not far from Antwerp itself, in which de Marnix was routed and slain
      (March 13th, 1567).</p>
<h3>&sect; 5. <i>William of Orange.</i></h3>
<p>Meanwhile William of Orange had come to the conclusion that Philip was
      meditating the suppression of the rights and liberties of the Low Countries
      by Spanish troops, and was convinced that the great nobles who had
      hitherto headed the constitutional opposition would be the first to
      be attacked. He had conferences with Egmont and Hoorn at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg
      255]</a></span> Dendermonde (Oct. 3rd, 1566), and at Willebroek (April
      2nd, 1567), and endeavoured to persuade them that the only course open
      to them was to resist by force of arms. His arguments were unavailing,
      and William sadly determined that he must leave the country and retire
      to his German estates.</p>
<p>His forebodings were only too correct. Philip had resolved to send the
      Duke of Alva to subdue the Netherlands. A force of nine thousand veteran
      Spanish infantry with thirteen hundred Italian cavalry had been collected
      from the garrisons of Lombardy and Naples, and Alva began a long, difficult
      march over the Mt. Cenis and through Franche-Comt&eacute;, Lorraine,
      and Luxemburg. William had escaped just in time. When the Duke arrived
      in Brussels and presented his credentials to the Council of State,
      it was seen that the King had bestowed on him such extensive powers
      that Margaret remained Regent in name only. One of his earliest acts
      was to get possession of the persons of Counts Egmont and Hoorn, with
      their private secretaries, and to imprison Antony van Straelen, Burgomaster
      of Antwerp, and a confidential friend of the Prince of Orange. Many
      other arrests were made; and Alva, having caught his victims, invented
      an instrument to help him to dispose of them.</p>
<p>By the mere fiat of his will he created a judicial chamber, whose decisions
      were to override those of any other court of law in the Netherlands,
      and which was to be responsible to none, not even to the Council of
      State. It was called the <i>Council of Tumults</i>, but is better known
      by its popular name, <i>The Bloody Tribunal</i>. It consisted of twelve
      members, among whom were Barlaymont and a few of the most violent Romanists
      of the Netherlands; but only two, Juan de Vargas and del Rio, both
      Spaniards, were permitted to vote and influence the decisions. Del
      Rio was a nonentity; but de Vargas was a very stern reality&mdash;a
      man of infamous life, equally notorious for the delight he took in
      slaughtering his fellow-men and the facility with which he murdered
      the Latin language! He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg
      256]</a></span> brought the whole population of the Netherlands within
      the grip of the public executioner by his indictment: <i>H&aelig;retici
      fraxerunt templa, boni nihil faxerunt contra; ergo debent omnes patibulure:</i> by
      which he meant, <i>The heretics have broken open churches, the orthodox
      have done nothing to hinder them; therefore they ought all of them
      to be hanged together.</i> Alva reserved all final decisions for his
      own judgment, in order that the work might be thoroughly done. He wrote
      to the King, &ldquo;Men of law only condemn for crimes that are proved, whereas
      your Majesty knows that affairs of State are governed by very different
      rules from the laws which they have here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At its earlier sittings this terrible tribunal defined the crime of treason,
      and stated that its punishment was death. The definition extended to
      eighteen articles, and declared it to be treason&mdash;to have presented
      or signed any petition against the new bishoprics, the Inquisition,
      or the <i>Placards</i>; to have tolerated public preaching under any
      circumstances; to have omitted to resist iconoclasm, or field-preaching,
      or the presentation of the <i>Request</i>; to have asserted that the
      King had not the right to suspend the charters of the provinces; or
      to maintain that the Council of Tumults had not a right to override
      all the laws and privileges of the Netherlands. All these things were
      treason, and all of them were capital offences. Proof was not required;
      all that was needed was reasonable suspicion, or rather what the Duke
      of Alva believed to be so. The Council soon got to work. It sent commissioners
      through every part of the land&mdash;towns, villages, districts&mdash;to
      search for any who might be suspected of having committed any act which
      could be included within their definition of treason. Informers were
      invited, were bribed, to come forward; and soon shoals of denunciations
      and evidence flowed in to them. The accused were brought before the
      Council, tried (if the procedure could be called a trial), and condemned
      in batches. The records speak of ninety-five, eighty-four, forty-six,
      thirty-five at a time. Alva wrote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg
      257]</a></span> to Philip that no fewer than fifteen hundred had been
      taken in their beds early on Ash-Wednesday morning, and later he announces
      another batch of eight hundred. In each case he adds, &ldquo;I have ordered
      all of them to be executed.&rdquo; In view of these records, the language
      of a contemporary chronicler does not appeared exaggerated:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;The gallows, the wheel, stakes, trees along the highways, were
            laden with carcasses or limbs of those who had been hanged, beheaded,
            or roasted; so that the air which God made for the respiration
            of the living, was now become the common grave or habitation
            of the dead. Every day produced fresh objects of pity and of
            mourning, and the noise of the bloody passing-bell was continually
            heard, which by the martyrdom of this man&rsquo;s cousin, and the other&rsquo;s
            brother or friend, rang dismal peals in the hearts of the survivors.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whole families left their dwellings to shelter themselves in the woods,
      and, goaded by their misery, pillaged and plundered. The priests had
      been active as informers, and these <i>Wild-Beggars</i>, as they were
      called, &ldquo;made excursions on them, serving themselves of the darkest
      nights for revenge and robbery, punishing them not only by despoiling
      them of their goods, but by disfiguring their faces, cutting off ears
      and noses.&rdquo; The country was in a state of anarchy.</p>
<p>Margaret, Duchess of Parma, the nominal Regent of the Netherlands, had
      found her position intolerable since the arrival of the Duke of Alva,
      and was permitted by Philip to resign (Oct. 6th, 1567). Alva henceforth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg
      258]</a></span> was untrammelled by even nominal restraint. A process
      was begun against the Counts Egmont and Hoorn, and William of Orange
      was proclaimed an outlaw (Jan. 24th, 1568) unless he submitted himself
      for trial before the <i>Council of Tumults</i>. Some days afterwards,
      his eldest son, a boy of fifteen and a student in the University of
      Louvain, was kidnapped and carried off to Spain.<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>
<p>William replied in his famous <i>Justification of the Prince of Orange
            against his Calumniators</i>, in which he declared that he, a
            citizen of Brabant, a Knight of the Golden Fleece, a Prince of
            the Holy Roman Empire, one of the sovereign Princes of Europe
            (in virtue of the principality of Orange), could not be summoned
            before an incompetent tribunal. He reviewed the events in the
            Netherlands since the accession of Philip <span class="smcap">II.</span>,
            and spoke plainly against the misgovernment caused, he said diplomatically,
            by the evil counsels of the King&rsquo;s advisers. The <i>Justification</i> was
            published in several languages, and was not merely an act of
            defiance to Philip, but a plea made on behalf of his country
            to the whole of civilised Europe.</p>
<p>The earlier months of 1568 had been spent by the Prince of Orange in military
      preparations for the relief of his countrymen, and in the spring his
      army was ready. The campaign was a failure. Hoogstraten was defeated.
      Louis of Nassau had a temporary success at Heiliger-Lee (May 23rd,
      1568), only to be routed at Jemmingen (July 21st, 1568). After William
      had issued a pathetic but unavailing manifesto to Protestant Europe,
      a second expedition was sent forth only to meet defeat. The cause of
      the Netherlands seemed hopeless.</p>
<p>But Alva was beginning to find himself in difficulties. On the news of
      the repulse of his troops at Heiliger-Lee he had hastily beheaded the
      Counts Egmont and Hoorn. Instead of striking terror into the hearts
      of the Netherlanders, the execution roused them to an undying hatred
      of the Spaniard. He was now troubled by lack of money to pay his troops.
      He had promised Philip to make gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg
      259]</a></span> flow from the Low Countries to Spain; but his rule
      had destroyed the commerce and manufactures of the country, the source
      of its wealth. He was almost dependent on subsidies from Spain. Elizabeth
      of England had been assisting her fellow Protestants in the way she
      liked best, by seizing Spanish treasure ships; and Alva was reduced
      to find the money he needed within the Netherlands.</p>
<p>It was then that he proposed to the States General, summoned to meet him
      (March 20th, 1569), his notorious scheme of taxation, which finally
      ruined him&mdash;a tax of one per cent. (the &ldquo;hundredth penny&rdquo;) to
      be levied once for all on all property; a tax of five per cent. (the &ldquo;twentieth
      penny&rdquo;) to be levied at every sale or transfer of landed property:
      and a tax of ten per cent. (the &ldquo;tenth penny&rdquo;) on all articles of commerce
      each time they were sold. This scheme of taxation would have completely
      ruined a commercial and manufacturing country. It met with universal
      resistance. Provinces, towns, magistrates, guilds, the bishops and
      the clergy&mdash;everyone protested against the taxation. Even Philip&rsquo;s
      Council at Madrid saw the impossibility of exacting such taxes from
      a country. Alva swore that he would have his own way. The town and
      district of Utrecht had been the first to protest. Alva quartered the
      regiment of Lombardy upon them; but not even the licence and brutality
      of the soldiers could force the wretched people to pay. Alva proclaimed
      the whole of the inhabitants to be guilty of high treason; he took
      from them all their charters and privileges; he declared their whole
      property confiscated to the King. But these were the acts of a furious
      madman, and were unavailing. He then postponed the collection of the
      hundredth and of the tenth pennies; but the need of money forced him
      on, and he gave definite orders for the collection of the
      &ldquo;tenth&rdquo; and the &ldquo;twentieth pennies.&rdquo; The trade and manufactures of
      the country came to a sudden standstill, and Alva at last knew that
      he was beaten. He had to be satisfied with a payment of two millions
      of florins for two years.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></p>
<p>The real fighting force among the Reformed Netherlanders was to be found,
      not among the landsmen, but in the sailors and fishermen. It is said
      that Admiral Coligny was the first to point this out to the Prince
      of Orange. He acted upon the advice, and in 1569 he had given letters
      of marque to some eighteen small vessels to cruise in the narrow seas
      and attack the Spaniards. At first they were little better than pirates,&mdash;men
      of various nationalities united by a fierce hatred of Spaniards and
      Papists, feared by friends and foes alike. William attempted, at first
      somewhat unsuccessfully, to reduce them to discipline and order, by
      issuing with his letters of marque orders limiting their indiscriminate
      pillage, insisting upon the maintenance of religious services on board,
      and declaring that one-third of the booty was to be given to himself
      for the common good of the country. In their earlier days they were
      allowed to refit and sell their plunder in English ports, but these
      were closed to them on strong remonstrances from the Court of Spain.
      It was almost by accident that they seized and held (April 1st, 1572)
      Brill or Brielle, a strongly fortified town on Voorn, which was then
      an island at the mouth of the Maas, some twenty miles west or seaward
      from Rotterdam. The inhabitants were forced to take an oath of allegiance
      to William as Stadtholder under the King, and the flag of what was
      afterwards to become the United Provinces was hoisted on land for the
      first time. It was not William, but his brother Louis of Nassau, who
      was the first to see the future possibilities in this act. He urged
      the seizure of Flushing or Vlissingen, the chief stronghold in Zeeland,
      situated on an island at the mouth of the Honte or western Scheldt,
      and commanding the entrance to Antwerp. The citizens rose in revolt
      against the Spanish garrison; the <i>Sea-Beggars</i>, as they were
      called, hurried to assist them; the town was taken, and the Spanish
      commander, Pachecho, was captured and hanged. This gave the seamen
      possession of the whole island of Walcheren save the fortified town
      of Middleburg. Delfshaven and Schiedam were seized. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg
      261]</a></span> news swept through Holland, Zeeland, Guelderland, Utrecht,
      and Friesland, and town after town declared for William of Orange the
      Stadtholder. The leaders were marvellously encouraged to renewed exertions.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> Proclamations
      in the name of the new ruler were scattered broadcast through the country,
      and the people were fired by a song said to be written by Sainte Aldegonde, <i>Wilhelmus
      van Nassouwe</i>, which is still the national hymn of Holland. The
      Prince of Orange thought he might venture on another invasion, and
      was already near Brussels when the news of the Massacre of Saint Bartholomew
      reached him. His plans had been based on assistance from France, urged
      by Coligny and promised by Charles <span class="smcap">IX.</span> &ldquo;What
      a sledge-hammer blow (<i>coup de massue</i>) that has been,&rdquo; he wrote
      to his brother; &ldquo;my only hope was from France.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> Mons,
      which Louis had seized in the south with his French troops, had to
      be abandoned; and William, after some vain efforts, had to disband
      his troops.</p>
<p>Then Alva came out from Brussels to wreak a fearful vengeance on Mons,
      Mechlin, Tergoes, Naarden, Haarlem, and Zutphen. The terms of the capitulation
      of Mons were violated. Mechlin was plundered and set on fire by the
      Spanish troops. The Spanish commander sent against Zutphen had orders
      to burn every house, and to slay men, women, and children. Haarlem
      was invested, resisted desperately, and then capitulated on promise
      of lenient treatment. When the Spaniards entered they butchered in
      cold blood all the Dutch soldiers and some hundreds of the citizens;
      and, tying the bodies two and two together, they cast them into the
      Haarlem lake. It seemed as if the Papists had determined to exterminate
      the Protestants when they found that they could not convert them.</p>
<p>Some towns, however, held out. Don Frederick, the son of Alva and the
      butcher of Haarlem, was beaten back from the little town of Alkmaar.
      The <i>Sea-Beggars</i> met the Spanish fleet sent to crush them, sank
      or scattered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg
      262]</a></span> ships, and took the Admiral prisoner. The nation of
      fishermen and shopkeepers, once the scorn of Spain and of Europe for
      their patient endurance of indignities, were seen at last to be a race
      of heroes, determined never again to endure the yoke of the Spaniard.
      Alva had soon to face a soldiery mutinous for want of pay, and to see
      all his sea approaches in the hands of Dutch sailors, whom the strongest
      fleets of Spain could not subdue. The iron pitiless man at last acknowledged
      that he was beaten, and demanded his recall. He left Brussels on Dec.
      18th, 1573, and did not again see the land he had deluged with blood
      during a space of six years. Like all tyrants, he had great faith in
      his system, even when it had broken in his hand. Had he been a little
      more severe, added a few more drops to the sea of blood he had spilled,
      all would have gone well. The only advice he could give to his successor
      was, to burn down every town he could not garrison with Spanish troops.</p>
<p>The new Spanish Regent was Don Louis Requesens-y-Zuniga, a member of the
      higher nobility of Spain, and a Grand Commander of the Knights of Malta.
      He was high-minded, and of a generous disposition. Had he been sent
      to the Netherlands ten years sooner, and allowed to act with a free
      hand, the history of the Netherlands might have been different. His
      earlier efforts at government were marked by attempts to negotiate,
      and he was at pains to give Philip his reasons for his conduct.</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;Before my arrival,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;I could not comprehend how the rebels
            contrived to maintain fleets so considerable, while your Majesty
            could not maintain one. Now I see that men who are fighting for
            their lives, their families, their property, and their false
            religion, in short, for their own cause, are content if they
            receive only rations without pay.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He immediately reversed the policy of Alva: he repealed the hated taxes;
      dissolved the Council of Blood, and published a general amnesty. But
      he could not come to terms with the &ldquo;rebels.&rdquo; William of Orange refused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg
      263]</a></span> all negotiation which was not based on three preliminary
      conditions&mdash;freedom of conscience, and liberty to preach the Gospel
      according to the Word of God; the restoration of all the ancient charters;
      and the withdrawal of all Spaniards from all posts military and civil.
      He would accept no truce nor amnesty without these. &ldquo;We have heard
      too often,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the words <i>Agreed</i> and <i>Eternal</i>. If
      I have your word for it, who will guarantee that the King will not
      deny it, and be absolved for his breach of faith by the Pope?&rdquo; Requesens,
      hating the necessity, had to carry on the struggle which the policy
      of his King and of the Regents who preceded him had provoked.</p>
<p>The fortune of war seemed to be unchanged. The patriots were always victorious
      at sea and tenacious in desperate defence of their fortified towns
      when they were besieged, but they went down before the veteran Spanish
      infantry in almost every battle fought on land. In the beginning of
      1574 two fortresses were invested. The patriots were besieging Middleburg,
      and the Spaniards had invested Leyden. The <i>Sea-Beggars</i> routed
      the Spanish fleet in a bloody fight in the mouth of the Scheldt, and
      Middleburg had to surrender. Leyden had two months&rsquo; respite owing to
      a mutiny among the Spanish soldiers, but the citizens neglected the
      opportunity thus given them to revictual their town. It was again invested
      (May 26th), and hardly pressed. Louis of Nassau, leading an army to
      its assistance, was totally routed at Mookerheide, and he and his younger
      brother Henry were among the slain. The fate of Leyden seemed to be
      sealed, when William suggested to the Estates of Holland to cut the
      dykes and let in the sea. The plan was adopted. But the dykes took
      long to cut, and when they were opened and the water began to flow
      in slowly, violent winds swept it back to the sea. Within Leyden the
      supply of food was melting away; and the famished and anxious burghers,
      looking over the plain from the steeples of the town, saw help coming
      so slowly that it seemed as if it could arrive only when it was too
      late. The Spaniards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg
      264]</a></span> knew also of the coming danger, and, calculating on
      the extremities of the townsfolk, urged on them to surrender, with
      promises of an honourable capitulation. &ldquo;We have two arms,&rdquo; one of
      the defenders on the walls shouted back,
      &ldquo;and when hunger forces us we will eat the one and fight you with the
      other.&rdquo; Four weary months passed amidst indescribable sufferings, when
      at last the sea reached the walls. With it came the patriotic fleet,
      sailing over buried corn fields and gardens, piloted through orchards
      and villages. The Spaniards fled in terror, for the <i>Sea-Beggars</i> were
      upon them, shouting their battle-cry, &ldquo;Sooner Turks than Papists.&rdquo; Townsmen
      and sailors went to the great church to offer thanksgiving for the
      deliverance which had been brought them from the sea. When the vast
      audience was singing a psalm of deliverance, the voices suddenly ceased,
      and nothing was heard but low sobbing; the people, broken by long watching
      and famine, overcome by unexpected deliverance, could only weep.</p>
<p>The good news was brought to Delft by Hans Brugge, who found William in
      church at the afternoon service. When the sermon was ended, the deliverance
      of Leyden was announced from the pulpit. William, weak with illness
      as he was, rode off to Leyden at once to congratulate the citizens
      on their heroic defence and miraculous deliverance. There he proposed
      the foundation of what became the famous University of Leyden, which
      became for Holland what Wittenberg had been to Germany, Geneva to Switzerland,
      and Saumur to France.</p>
<p>The siege of Leyden was the turning-point in the war for independence.
      The Spanish Regent saw that a new Protestant State was slowly and almost
      imperceptibly forming. His troops were almost uniformly victorious
      in the field, but the victories did not seem to be of much value. He
      decided once more to attempt negotiation. The conferences came to nothing.
      The utmost that Philip <span class="smcap">II.</span> would concede
      was that the Protestants should have time to sell their possessions
      and leave the country. The war was again renewed, when death came to
      relieve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span> Requesens
      of his difficulties (March 1575). His last months were disgraced by
      the recommendation he made to his master to offer a reward for the
      assassination of the Prince of Orange.</p>
<p>The history of the next few years is a tangled story which would take
      too long to tell. When Requesens died the treasury was empty, and no
      public money was forthcoming. The Spanish soldiers mutinied, clamouring
      for their pay. They seized on some towns and laid hold on the citadel
      of Antwerp. Then occurred the awful pillage of the great city, when,
      during three terrible November days, populous and wealthy Antwerp suffered
      all the horrors that could be inflicted upon it.</p>
<p>The sudden death of Requesens had left everything in confusion; and leading
      men, both Roman Catholic and Protestant, conceived that advantage should
      be taken of the absence of any Spanish Governor to see whether all
      the seventeen provinces of the Netherlands could not combine on some
      common programme which would unite the country in spite of their religious
      differences. Delegates met together at Ghent (Oct. 28th, 1576) and
      drafted a treaty. A meeting of States General for the southern provinces
      was called to assemble at Brussels in November, and the members were
      discussing the terms of the treaty when the news of the &ldquo;Spanish Fury&rdquo; at
      Antwerp reached them. The story of the ghastly horrors perpetrated
      on their countrymen doubtless hastened their decision, and the treaty
      was ratified both by the States General and by the Council of State.
      The <i>Pacification of Ghent</i> cemented an alliance between the southern
      provinces represented in the States General which met at Brussels and
      the northern provinces of Holland and Zeeland. Its chief provisions
      were that all should combine to drive the Spanish and other foreign
      troops out of the land, and that a formal meeting of delegates from
      all the seventeen provinces should be called to deliberate upon the
      religious question. In the meantime the Roman Catholic religion was
      to be maintained; the <i>Placards</i> were to be abolished;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg
      266]</a></span> the Prince of Orange was declared to be the Governor
      of the seventeen provinces and the Admiral-General of Holland and Zeeland;
      and the confiscation of the properties of the houses of Nassau and
      Brederode was rescinded.</p>
<p>Don John of Austria had been appointed by Philip Regent of the Netherlands,
      and was in Luxemburg early in November. His arrival there was intimated
      to the States General, who refused to acknowledge him as Regent unless
      he would approve of the <i>Pacification of Ghent</i> and swear to maintain
      the ancient privileges of the various provinces. Months were spent
      in negotiations, but the States General were unmovable. He yielded
      at length, and made his State entry into Brussels on May 1st, 1577.
      When once there he found himself overshadowed by William, who had been
      accepted as leader by Roman Catholics and Protestants alike. But Philip
      with great exertions had got together an army of twenty thousand veteran
      Spanish and Italian troops, and sent them to the Netherlands under
      the command of Alexander Farnese, the son of the former Regent, Margaret
      Duchess of Parma. The young Duke of Parma was a man of consummate abilities,
      military and diplomatic, and was by far the ablest agent Philip ever
      had in the Low Countries. He defeated the patriotic army at Gemblours
      (Jan. 31st, 1578), and several towns at once opened their gates to
      Parma and Don John. To increase the confusion, John Casimir, brother
      of the Elector Palatine, invaded the land from the east at the head
      of a large body of German mercenary soldiers to assist the Calvinists;
      the Archduke Matthias, brother of the Emperor Rudolph, was already
      in the country, invited by the Roman Catholics; and the Duke of Anjou
      had invaded the Netherlands from the south to uphold the interests
      of those Romanists who did not wish to tolerate Protestantism but hated
      the Spaniards. These foreigners represented only too well the latent
      divisions of the country&mdash;divisions which were skilfully taken
      advantage of by the Duke of Parma. After struggling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg
      267]</a></span> in vain for a union of the whole seventeen provinces
      on the basis of complete religious toleration, William saw that his
      task was hopeless. Neither the majority of the Romanists nor the majority
      of the Protestants could understand toleration. Delegates of the Romanist
      provinces of Hainault, Douai, and Artois met at Arras (Jan. 5th, 1579)
      to form a league which had for its ultimate intention a reconciliation
      with Spain on the basis of the <i>Pacification of Ghent</i>, laying
      stress on the provision for the maintenance of the Roman Catholic religion.
      Thus challenged, the northern provinces of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht,
      Guelderland, and Zutphen met at Utrecht (Jan. 29th, 1579), and formed
      a league to maintain themselves against all foreign Princes, including
      the King of Spain. These two leagues mark the definite separation of
      the Romanist South from the Protestant North, and the creation of a
      new Protestant State, the United Provinces. William did not sign the
      Treaty of Utrecht until May 3rd.</p>
<p>In 1581, Philip made a last attempt to overcome his indomitable antagonist.
      He published the Ban against him, denouncing him as a traitor and an
      enemy of the human race, and offering a reward of twenty-five thousand
      crowns and a patent of nobility to anyone who should deliver him to
      the King dead or alive. William answered in his famous <i>Apology</i>,
      which gives an account of his whole career, and contains a scathing
      exposure of Philip&rsquo;s misdeeds. The <i>Apology</i> was translated into
      several languages, and sent to all the Courts of Europe. Brabant, Flanders,
      Utrecht, Guelderland, Holland, and Zeeland answered Philip by the celebrated
      Act of Abjuration (July 26th, 1581), in which they solemnly renounced
      allegiance to the King of Spain, and constituted themselves an independent
      republic.</p>
<p>The date of the abjuration may be taken as the beginning of the new era,
      the birth of another Protestant nation. Its young life had been consecrated
      in a baptism of blood and fire such as no other nation in Europe had
      to endure. Its Declaration of Independence did not procure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg
      268]</a></span> immediate relief. Nearly thirty years of further struggle
      awaited it; and it was soon to mourn the loss of its heroic leader.
      The rewards promised by Philip <span class="smcap">II.</span> were
      a spur to the zeal of Romanist fanatics. In 1582 (March 18th), Juan
      Jaureguy, a Biscayan, made a desperate attempt at assassination, which
      for the moment was thought to be successful. The pistol was so close
      to the Prince that his hair and beard were set on fire, and the ball
      entering under the right ear, passed through the palate and out by
      the left jaw. Two years later (July 9th, 1584), William fell mortally
      wounded by Balthasar Gerard, whose heirs claimed the reward for assassination
      promised by Philip, and received part of it from the King. The Prince&rsquo;s
      last words were: &ldquo;My God, have mercy on my soul and on these poor people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sixteenth century produced no nobler character than that of William,
      Prince of Orange. His family were Lutherans, but they permitted the
      lad to be brought up in the Roman Catholic religion&mdash;the condition
      which Charles v. had imposed before he would consent to give effect
      to the will of Ren&eacute;, Prince of Orange,<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> who,
      dying at the early age of twenty-six, had left his large possessions
      to his youthful cousin, William of Nassau. In an intolerant age he
      stands forth as the one great leader who rose above the religious passions
      of the time, and who strove all his life to secure freedom of conscience
      and right of public worship for men of all creeds.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> He
      was a consistent liberal Roman Catholic down to the close of 1555.
      His letter (January 24th, 1566) to Margaret of Parma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg
      269]</a></span> perhaps reveals the beginnings of a change. He called
      himself &ldquo;a good Christian,&rdquo; not a &ldquo;good Catholic.&rdquo; Before the end of
      that year he had said privately that he was ready to return to the
      faith of his childhood and subscribe the Augsburg Confession. During
      his exile in 1568 he had made a daily study of the Holy Scriptures,
      and, whatever the exact shade of his theological opinions, had become
      a deeply religious man, animated with the lofty idea that God had called
      him to do a great work for Him and for His persecuted people. His private
      letters, meant for no eyes but those of his wife or of his most familiar
      friends, are full of passages expressing a quiet faith in God and in
      the leadings of His Providence.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> During
      the last years of his life the teachings of Calvin had more and more
      taken hold on his intellect and sympathy, and he publicly declared
      himself a Calvinist in 1573 (October 23rd). A hatred of every form
      of oppression was his ruling passion, and he himself has told us that
      it was when he learnt that the Kings of France and Spain had come to
      a secret understanding to extirpate heresy by fire and sword, that
      he made the silent resolve to drive &ldquo;This vermin of Spaniards out of
      his country.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>
<p>The Protestant Netherlands might well believe themselves lost when he
      fell under the pistol of the assassin; but he left them a legacy in
      the persons of his confidential friend Johan van Oldenbarneveldt and
      of his son Maurice. Oldenbarneveldt&rsquo;s patient diplomatic genius completed
      the political work left unfinished by William; and Maurice,<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg
      270]</a></span> a lad of seventeen at his father&rsquo;s death, was acknowledged
      only a few years afterwards as the greatest military leader in Europe.
      The older man in the politician&rsquo;s study, and the boy-general in the
      field, were able to keep the Spaniards at bay, until at length, in
      1607 (October), a suspension of arms was agreed to. This resulted in
      a truce for twelve years (April 9th, 1609), which was afterwards prolonged
      indefinitely. The Dutch had won their independence, and had become
      a strong Protestant power whose supremacy at sea was challenged only
      by England.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the severity of the persecutions which they endured, the
      Protestants of the Netherlands organised themselves into churches,
      and as early as 1563 the delegates from the various churches met in
      a synod to settle the doctrine and discipline which was to bind them
      together. This was not done without internal difficulties. The people
      of the Netherlands had received the Evangelical faith from various
      sources, and the converts tenaciously clung to the creed and ecclesiastical
      system with which they were first acquainted. The earliest Reformation
      preachers in the Low Countries were followers of Luther, and many of
      them had been trained at Wittenberg. Lutherans were numerous among
      the lesser nobility and the more substantial burghers. Somewhat later
      the opinions of Zwingli also found their way into the Netherlands,
      and were adopted by many very sincere believers. The French-speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg
      271]</a></span> provinces in the south had been evangelised for the
      most part by missioners trained under Calvin at Geneva, and they brought
      his theology with them. Thus Luther, Zwingli, and Calvin had all attached
      followers in the Low Countries. The differences found expression, not
      so much in matters of doctrine as in preferences for different forms
      of Church government; and although they were almost overcome, they
      reappeared later in the contest which emerged in the beginning of the
      seventeenth century about the relation which ought to subsist between
      the civil and the ecclesiastical authorities. In the end, the teaching
      of Geneva displaced both Lutheranism and Zwinglianism, and the Reformed
      in the Netherlands became Calvinist in doctrine and discipline.</p>
<p>Accordingly, most of the churches were early organised on the principles
      of the churches in France, with a minister and a consistory of elders
      and deacons; and when delegates from the churches met to deliberate
      upon an organisation which would bind all together, the system which
      was adopted was the Presbyterian or Conciliar. The meeting was at Emden
      (1569), as it was too dangerous to assemble within the jurisdiction
      of the Government of the Netherlands. It was resolved that the Church
      should be ruled by <i>consistories, classes</i>, and <i>synods</i>.
      This Conciliar organisation, thus adopted at Emden in 1569, might not
      have met with unanimous support had not the Reformed been exposed to
      the full fury of Alva&rsquo;s persecution. The consistorial system of the
      Lutheran Church, and the position which Zwingli assigned to the magistracy,
      are possible only when the civil government is favourably disposed
      towards the Church within the land which it rules; but Presbyterianism,
      as France, Scotland, and the Netherlands have proved, is the best suited
      for &ldquo;a Church under the Cross.&rdquo; Nor need this be wondered at, for the
      Presbyterian or Conciliar is the revival of the government of the Church
      of the early centuries while still under the ban of the Roman Empire.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></p>
<p>A synod which met at Dordrecht (Dort) in 1572 revised, enlarged, and formally
      adopted the articles of this Emden synod or conference.</p>
<p>Two peculiarities of the Dutch organisation ought to be explained. The <i>consistory</i> or
      kirk-session is the court which rules the individual congregation in
      Holland as in all other Presbyterian lands; but in the Dutch Church
      all Church members inhabiting a city are regarded as one congregation;
      the ministers are the pastors of the city, preaching in turn in all
      its buildings set apart for public worship, and the people are not
      considered to be specially attached to any one of the buildings, nor
      to belong to the flock of any one of the ministers; and therefore there
      is one consistory for the whole city. This peculiarity was also seen
      in the early centuries. Then it must be noticed that, owing to the
      political organisation of the United Provinces, it was difficult to
      arrange for a National Synod. The civil constitution was a federation
      of States, in many respects independent of each other, who were bound
      to protect each other in war, to maintain a common army, and to contribute
      to a common military treasury. When William of Orange was elected Stadtholder
      for life, one of the laws which bound him was that he should not acknowledge
      any ecclesiastical assembly which had not the approval of the civil
      authorities of the province in which it proposed to meet. This implied
      that each province was entitled to regulate its own ecclesiastical
      affairs. There could be no meeting of a National Synod unless all the
      United Provinces gave their approval. Hence the tendency was to prevent
      corporate and united action.</p>
<p>According to the articles of Emden, and the revised and enlarged edition
      approved at Dordrecht in 1572, it was agreed that office-bearers in
      the Church were to sign the <i>Confession of Faith</i>. This creed
      had been prepared by Guido de Br&egrave;s (born at Mons in 1540) in
      1561, and had been revised by several of his friends. It was based
      on the Confession of the French Church, and was originally written
      in French. It was approved by a series<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg
      273]</a></span> of Synods, and was translated into Dutch, German, and
      Latin. It is known as the Belgic Confession. Its original title was, <i>A
      Confession of Faith, generally and unanimously maintained by Believers
      dispersed throughout the Low Countries who desire to live according
      to the purity of the Holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.</i><a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> The
      Church also adopted the <i>Heidelberg Catechism</i><a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> for
      the instruction of the young.</p>
<p>The long fight against Spain and the Inquisition had stimulated the energies
      of the Church and the people of the Netherlands, and their Universities
      and theological schools soon rivalled older seats of learning. The
      University of Leyden, a thank-offering for the wonderful deliverance
      of the town, was founded in 1575; Franecker, ten years later, in 1585;
      and there followed in rapid succession the Universities of Gronningen
      (1612), Utrecht (1636), and Harderwyk (1648). Dutch theologians and
      lawyers became famous during the seventeenth century for their learning
      and acumen.</p>

<h3>THE REFORMATION IN SCOTLAND.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></h3>
<p>If civilisation means the art of living together in peace, Scotland was
      almost four hundred years behind the rest of Western Europe in the
      beginning of the sixteenth century.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></p>
<p>The history of her kings is a tale of assassinations, long minorities,
      regencies scrambled and fought for by unscrupulous barons; and kingly
      authority, which had been growing in other countries, was on the verge
      of extinction in Scotland. Her Parliament or Estates of the Realm was
      a mere feudal assembly, with more than the usual uncertainty regarding
      who were entitled to be present; while its peculiar management by a
      Committee of the Estates made it a facile instrument in the hands of
      the faction who were for the moment in power, and robbed it of any
      stable influence on the country as a whole. The Church, wealthy so
      far as acreage was concerned, had become secularised to an extent unknown
      elsewhere, and its benefices served to provide for the younger sons
      of the great feudal families in a manner which recalls the days of
      Charles the Hammer.<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>
<p>Yet the country had been prepared for the Reformation by the education
      of the people, especially of the middle class, by constant intercourse
      between Scotland and France and the Low Countries, and by the sympathy
      which Scottish students had felt for the earlier movements towards
      Church reform in England and Bohemia; while the wealth and immorality
      of the Romish clergy, the poverty of the nobility and landed gentry,
      and the changing political situation, combined to give an impetus to
      the efforts of those who longed for a Reformation.</p>
<p>More than one historian has remarked that the state of education in Scotland
      had always been considerably in advance of what might have been expected
      from its backward civilisation. This has been usually traced to the
      enduring influence of the old Celtic Church&mdash;a Church which had
      maintained its hold on the country for more than seven centuries, and
      which had always looked upon the education of the people as a religious
      duty. Old Celtic ecclesiastical rules declared that it was as important
      to teach boys and girls to read, as to dispense the sacraments, and
      to take part in <i>soul-friendship</i> (confession). The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg
      276]</a></span> Celtic monastery had always been an educational centre;
      and when Charles the Great established the High Schools which grew
      to be the older Universities of northern Europe, the Celtic monasteries
      furnished many of the teachers. The very complete educational system
      of the old Church had been taken over into the Roman Church which supplanted
      it, under Queen Margaret and her sons. Hence it was that the Cathedral
      and Monastery Schools produced a number of scholars who were eager
      to enrich their stores of learning beyond what the mother-country could
      give them, and the Scotch wandering student was well known during the
      Middle Ages on the Continent of Europe. One Scottish bishop founded
      a Scots College in Paris for his countrymen; other bishops obtained
      from English kings safe-conducts for their students to reside at Oxford
      and Cambridge.</p>
<p>This scholastic intercourse brought Scotland in touch with the intellectual
      movements in Europe. Scottish students at Paris listened to the lectures
      of Peter Dubois and William of Ockham when they taught the theories
      contained in the <i>Defensor Pacis</i> of Marsiglio of Padua, who had
      expounded that the Church is not the hierarchy, but the Christian people,
      and had denied both the temporal and spiritual supremacy of the Pope.
      The <i>Rotuli Scoti&aelig;</i>,<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> or
      collection of safe-conducts issued by English monarchs to inhabitants
      of the northern kingdom, show that a continuous stream of Scottish
      students went to the English Universities from 1357 to 1389. During
      the earlier years of this period&mdash;that is, up to 1364&mdash;the
      safe-conducts applied for and granted entitled the bearers to go to
      Oxford or Cambridge or any other place of learning in England; but
      from 1364 to 1379 Oxford seems to have been the only University frequented.
      During one of these years (1365) safe-conducts were given to no fewer
      than eighty-one Scottish students to study in Oxford. The period was
      that during which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg
      277]</a></span> the influence of Wiclif was most powerful, when Oxford
      seethed with Lollardy; and the teachings of the great Reformer were
      thus brought into Scotland.</p>
<p>Lollardy seems to have made great progress. In 1405, Robert, Duke of Albany,
      was made Governor of Scotland, and Andrew Wyntoun in his Metrical Chronicle
      praises him for his fidelity to the Church:</p>
<div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza"> <span class="i0">&ldquo;He wes a constant Catholike,<br />
            </span> <span class="i1">All Lollard he hatyt and heretike.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a><br />
      </span> </div>
</div>
<p>From this time down to the very dawn of the Reformation we find references
      to Lollardy in contemporary writers and in Acts of the Scots Parliament;
      and all the earlier histories of the Reformation movement in Scotland
      relate the story of the Lollards of Kyle and their interview with King
      James <span class="smcap">IV.</span><a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></p>
<p>The presence of Lollard opinions in Scotland must have attracted the attention
      of the leaders of the Hussites in Bohemia. In 1433 (July 23rd), Paul
      Craw or Crawar was seized, tried before the Inquisitorial court, condemned,
      and burnt as a heretic. He had brought letters from the Hussites of
      Prag, and acknowledged that he had been sent to interest the Scots
      in the Hussite movement&mdash;one of the many emissaries who were despatched
      in 1431 and 1432 by Procopius and John Rokycana into all European lands.
      He was found by the Inquisitor to be a man <i>in sacris literis et
      in allegatione Bibli&aelig; promptus et exercitatus</i>. Knox tells
      us that he was condemned for denying transubstantiation, auricular
      confession to the priests, and prayers to saints departed. We learn
      also from Knox that at his burning the executioner put a ball of brass
      in his mouth that the people might not hear his defence. His execution
      did not arrest the progress of Lollardy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg
      278]</a></span> The earlier poems of Sir David Lindsay contain Lollard
      opinions. By the time that these were published (1529-1530), Lutheran
      writings had found their way into Scotland, and may have influenced
      the writer; but the sentiments in the <i>Testament and Complaynt of
      the Papyngo</i> are more Lollard than Lutheran.</p>
<p>The Romish Church in Scotland was comparatively wealthy, and the rude
      Scottish nobles managed to place their younger sons in many a fat living,
      with the result that the manners of the clergy did little honour to
      their sacred calling. Satirists began to point the moral. John Row
      says:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;As for the more particulare means whereby many in Scotland got
            some knowledge of God&rsquo;s trueth, in the time of great darkness,
            there were some books sett out, such as Sir David Lindesay his
            poesie upon the <i>Four Monarchies</i>, wherein many other treatises
            are conteined, opening up the abuses among the Clergie at that
            tyme; Wedderburn&rsquo;s Psalms and <i>Godlie Ballads</i>, changing
            many of the old Popish songs unto Godlie purposes; a <i>Complaint</i> given
            in by the halt, blinde and poore of England, aganis the prelats,
            preists, friers, and others such kirkmen, who prodigallie wasted
            all the tithes and kirk liveings upon their unlawfull pleasures,
            so that they could get no sustentation nor releef as God had
            ordained. This was printed and came into Scotland. There were
            also some theatricall playes, comedies, and other notable histories
            acted in publict; for Sir David Lindesay his Satyre was acted
            in the Amphitheater of St. Johnestoun (Perth), before King James
            the <span class="smcap">V.</span>, and a great part of the nobilitie
            and gentrie, fra morn to even, whilk made the people sensible
            of the darknes wherein they lay, of the wickednes of their kirkmen,
            and did let them see how God&rsquo;s Kirk should have bene otherwayes
            guyded nor it was; all of whilk did much good for that tyme.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may be doubted, however, whether the Scottish people felt the real
      sting in such satires until they began to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg
      279]</a></span> taught by preachers who had been to Wittenberg, or
      who had studied the writings of Luther and other Reformers, or who
      had learned from private perusal of the Scriptures what it was to be
      in earnest about pardon of sin and salvation of soul.</p>
<p>Some of the towns on the East Coast were centres of trade with the Continent,
      and Leith had once been an obscure member of the great Hanseatic League.
      Lutheran and other tracts were smuggled into Scotland from Campvere
      by way of Leith, Dundee, and Montrose. The authorities were on the
      alert, and tried to put an end to the practice. In 1525, Parliament
      forbade strangers bringing Lutheran books into Scotland on pain of
      imprisonment and forfeiture of their goods and ships;<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> and
      in the same year the Government were informed that &ldquo;sundry strangers
      and others within the diocese of Aberdeen were possessed of Luther&rsquo;s
      books, and favoured his errors and false opinions.&rdquo;
      Two years later (1527), the Act was made to include those who assisted
      in spreading Lutheran views. An agent of Wolsey informed the Cardinal
      that Scottish merchants were purchasing copies of Tyndale&rsquo;s New Testament
      in the Low Countries and sending them to Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> The
      efforts of the Government do not seem to have been very successful.
      Another Act of Parliament in 1535 declared that none but the clergy
      were to be allowed to purchase heretical books; all others possessing
      such were required to give them up within forty days.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> This
      legislation clearly shows the spread of Reformed writings among the
      people of Scotland.</p>
<p>The first Scottish martyr was Patrick Hamilton, a younger son of Sir Patrick
      Hamilton of Kincavel and Stanehouse. He had studied at Paris and Louvain.
      As he took his degree of M.A. in Paris in 1520, he had been there when
      the writings of Luther were being studied by all learned men, including
      the theological students of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg
      280]</a></span> Sorbonne (the theological faculty).<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> Hamilton
      must have been impressed by the principles of the German Reformer,
      and have made no secret of his views when he returned to Scotland;
      for in the beginning of 1527 he was a suspected heretic, and was ordered
      to be summoned and accused as such. He fled from Scotland, went to
      Wittenberg, was at the opening of Philip of Hesse&rsquo;s new Evangelical
      University of Marburg (May 30th, 1527), and drafted the theses for
      the first academic Disputation.<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> He
      felt constrained, however, to return to his native land to testify
      against the corruptions of the Roman Church, and was preaching in Scotland
      in the end of autumn 1527. The success attending his ministry excited
      the fears of the prelates. He was invited, or rather enticed, to St.
      Andrews; allowed for nearly a month to preach and dispute in the University;
      and was then arrested and tried in the cathedral. The trial took place
      in the forenoon, and at mid-day he was hurried to the stake (Feb. 27th,
      1528). The fire by carelessness rather than with intention was slow,
      and death came only after lingering hours of agony.</p>
<p>If the ecclesiastical authorities thought to stamp out the new faith by
      this martyrdom, they were soon to discover their mistake. Alexander
      Alane (Alesius), who had undertaken to convince Patrick Hamilton of
      his errors, had been himself converted. He was arrested and imprisoned,
      but escaped to the Continent. The following years witnessed a succession
      of martyrs&mdash;Henry Forrest (1533), David Stratton and Norman Gourlay
      (1534), Duncan Simpson, Forrester, Keillor, Beverage, Forret, Russell,
      and Kennedy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg
      281]</a></span> (1539). The celebrated George Buchanan was imprisoned,
      but managed to escape.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> The
      Scots Parliament and Privy Council assisted the Churchmen to extirpate
      the new faith in a series of enactments which themselves bear witness
      to its spread. In 1540, in a series of Acts (March 14th) it was declared
      that the Virgin Mary was &ldquo;to be reverently worshipped, and prayers
      made to her&rdquo; for the King&rsquo;s prosperity, for peace with all Christian
      princes, for the triumph of the &ldquo;Faith Catholic,&rdquo; and that the people &ldquo;may
      remain in the faith and conform to the statutes of Holy Kirk.&rdquo;
      Prayers were also ordered to be made to the saints. It was forbidden
      to argue against, or impugn, the papal authority under pain of death
      and confiscation of &ldquo;goods movable and immovable.&rdquo; No one is to &ldquo;cast
      down or otherwise treat irreverently or in any ways dishonour&rdquo; the
      images of saints canonised by the Church. Heretics who have seen the
      error of their ways are not to discuss with others any matters touching &ldquo;our
      holy faith.&rdquo; No one suspected of heresy, even if he has recanted, is
      to be eligible to hold any office, nor to be admitted to the King&rsquo;s
      Council. All who assist heretics are threatened with severe punishment.
      In 1543, notwithstanding all this legislation, the Lord Governor (the
      Earl of Arran) had to confess that heretics increase rapidly, and spread
      opinions contrary to the Church.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> The
      terms of some of these enactments show that the new faith had been
      making converts among the nobility; and they also indicate the chief
      points of attack on the Roman Church in Scotland.</p>
<p>In 1542 (Dec. 14th), James <span class="smcap">V.</span> died, leaving
      an infant daughter, Mary (b. Dec. 8th), who became the Queen of Scots
      when barely a week old. Thus Scotland was again harassed with an infant
      sovereign; and there was the usual scramble for the Regency, which
      this time involved questions of national policy as well as personal
      aggrandisement.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></p>
<p>It was the settled policy of the Tudor kings to detach Scotland from the
      old French alliance, and secure it for England. The marriage of Margaret
      Tudor to James iv. shows what means they thought to employ, and but
      for Margaret&rsquo;s quarrel with the Earl of Angus, her second husband,
      another wedding might have bound the nations firmly together. The French
      marriages of James <span class="smcap">V.</span>, first with Madeleine,
      daughter of Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span> (1537), and on her
      premature death with Mary of Guise (1538), showed the recoil of Scotland
      from the English alliance. James&rsquo; death gave Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> an
      opportunity to renew his father&rsquo;s schemes, and his idea was to betroth
      his boy Edward to the baby Mary, and get the &ldquo;little Queen&rdquo; brought
      to England for education. Many Scotsmen thought the proposal a good
      one for their country, and perhaps more were induced to think so by
      the money which Henry lavished upon them to secure their support They
      made the English party in Scotland. The policy of English alliance
      as against French alliance was complicated by the question of religion.
      Whatever may be thought of the character of the English Reformation
      at this date, Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> had broken thoroughly
      with the Papacy, and union with England would have dragged Scotland
      to revolt against the medi&aelig;val Church. The leader of the French
      and Romanist party in Scotland was David Beaton, certainly the ablest
      and perhaps the most unscrupulous man there. He had been made Archbishop
      of St. Andrews, coadjutor to his aged uncle, in 1538. In the same month,
      Pope Paul iii., who needed a Churchman of the highest rank to publish
      his Bull against Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> in a place
      as near England as was possible to find, had sent him a Cardinal&rsquo;s
      Hat. The Cardinal, Beaton, stood in Scotland for France and Rome against
      England and the Reformation. The struggle for the Regency in Scotland
      in 1542 carried with it an international and a religious policy. The
      clouds heralding the storm which was to destroy Mary, gathered round
      the cradle of the baby Queen.</p>
<p>At first the English faction prevailed. The claims of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg
                  283]</a></span> the Queen Mother were scarcely considered.
                  Beaton produced a will, said to have been fraudulently
                  obtained from the dying King, appointing him and several
                  of the leading nobles of Scotland, Governors of the kingdom.
                  This arrangement was soon set aside, the Earl of Arran
                  was appointed Governor (Jan. 3rd, 1543), and Beaton was
                  confined in Blackness Castle.</p>
<p>The Governor selected John Rough for his chaplain and Thomas Williams
      for his preacher, both ardent Reformers. The Acts of the previous reign
      against heresy were modified to the extent that men suspect of heresy
      might enjoy office, and heretics were accorded more merciful treatment.
      Moreover, an Act of Parliament (March 15th, 1543) permitted the possession
      and reading of a good and true translation of the Old and New Testaments.
      But the masterful policy of Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> and
      the weakness of the Governor brought about a change. Beaton was released
      from Blackness and restored to his own Castle of St. Andrews; the Governor
      dismissed his Reformed preachers; the Privy Council (June 2nd, 1543)
      forbade on pain of death and confiscation of goods all criticism of
      the medi&aelig;val doctrine of the Sacraments, and forbade the possession
      of heretical books. In September, Arran and Beaton were reconciled;
      in December, the Parliament annulled the treaties with England consenting
      to a marriage between Edward and Mary, and the ancient league with
      France was renewed. This was followed by the revival of persecution,
      and almost all that had been gained was lost. Henry&rsquo;s ruthless devastation
      of the Borders did not mend matters. The more enlightened policy of
      Lord Protector Somerset could not allay the suspicions of the Scottish
      nation. Their &ldquo;little Queen&rdquo; was sent to France to be educated by the
      Guises, &ldquo;to the end that in hir youth she should drynk of that lycour,
      that should remane with hir all hir lyfetyme, for a plague to this
      realme, and for hir finall destructioun.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></p>
<p>But if the Reformation movement was losing ground as a national policy,
      it was gaining strength as a spiritual quickening in the hearts of
      the people. George Wishart, one of the Wisharts of Pittarrow, who had
      fled from persecution in 1538 and had wandered in England, Germany,
      and Switzerland, returned to his native country about 1543, consumed
      with the desire to bear witness for the Gospel. He preached in Montrose,
      and Dundee during a visitation of the plague, and Ayrshire. Beaton&rsquo;s
      party were anxious to secure him, and after a preaching tour in the
      Lothians he was seized in Ormiston House and handed over to the Earl
      of Bothwell, who, breaking pledges he had made, delivered him to the
      Cardinal; he lodged him in the dungeon at St. Andrews (end of Jan.
      1546), and had him tried in the cathedral, when he was condemned to
      the stake (March 1st, 1546).</p>
<p>Wishart was Knox&rsquo;s forerunner, and during this tour in the Lothians, Knox
      had been his constant companion. The Romanist party had tried to assassinate
      the bold preacher, and Knox carried a two-handed sword ready to cut
      down anyone who attempted to strike at the missionary while he was
      speaking. All the tenderness which lay beneath the sternness of Knox&rsquo;s
      character appears in the account he gives of Wishart in his <i>History</i>.
      And to Wishart, Knox was the beloved disciple. When he foresaw that
      the end was near, he refused to allow Knox to share his danger.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>
<p>Assassination was a not infrequent way of getting rid of a political opponent
      in the sixteenth century, and Beaton&rsquo;s death had long been planned,
      not without secret promptings from England. Three months after Wishart&rsquo;s
      martyrdom (May 29th, 1546), Norman Lesley and Kirkcaldy of Grange at
      the head of a small band of men broke into the Castle of St. Andrews
      and slew the Cardinal. They held the stronghold, and the castle became
      a place of refuge for men whose lives were threatened by the Government,
      and who sympathised with the English alliance. The Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg
      285]</a></span> laid siege to the place but were unable to take it,
      and their troops withdrew. John Rough, who had been Arran&rsquo;s Reformed
      chaplain, joined the company, and began to preach to the people of
      St. Andrews. Knox, who had become a marked man, and had thought of
      taking refuge in Germany, was persuaded to enter the castle, and there,
      sorely against his will, he was almost forced to stand forth as a preacher
      of the Word. His first sermon placed him at once in the foremost rank
      of Scottish Reformers, and men began to predict that he would share
      the fate of Wishart. &ldquo;Master George Wishart spak never so plainelye,
      and yitt he was brunt: evin so will he be.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>
<p>Next to nothing is known about the early history of John Knox. He came
      into the world at or near Haddington in the year 1515,<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> but
      on what day or month remains hidden. He sprang from the commons of
      Scotland, and his forebears were followers of the Earls of Bothwell;
      he was a papal notary, and in priest&rsquo;s orders in 1540; he was tutor
      to the sons of the lairds of Ormiston and Longniddry in 1545; he accompanied
      Wishart in December and January 1545, 1546&mdash;these are the facts
      known about him before he was called to stand forward as a preacher
      of the Reformation in Scotland. He was then thirty-two&mdash;a silent,
      slow ripening man, with quite a talent for keeping himself in the background.</p>
<p>Knox&rsquo;s work in the castle and town of St. Andrews was interrupted by the
      arrival of a French fleet (July 1547), which battered the walls with
      artillery until the castle was compelled to surrender. He and all the
      inmates were carried over to France. They had secured as terms of surrender
      that their lives should be spared; that they should be safely transported
      to France; and that if they could not accept the terms there offered
      to them by the French King, they should be allowed to depart to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg
      286]</a></span> any country they might select for their sojourn, save
      Scotland. It was not the custom, however, for French kings to keep
      promises made to heretics, and Knox and his companions were made galley-slaves.
      For nineteen months he had to endure this living death, which for long
      drawn out torture can only be compared with what the Christians of
      the earliest centuries had to suffer when they were condemned to the
      mines. He had to sit chained with four or six others to the rowing
      benches, which were set at right angles to the side of the ship, without
      change of posture by day, and compelled to sleep, still chained, under
      the benches by night; exposed to the elements day and night alike;
      enduring the lash of the overseer, who paced up and down the gangway
      which ran between the two lines of benches; feeding on the insufficient
      meals of coarse biscuit and porridge of oil and beans; chained along
      with the vilest malefactors. The French Papists had invented this method
      of treating all who differed from them in religious matters. It could
      scarcely make Knox the more tolerant of French policy or of the French
      religion. He seldom refers to this terrible experience. He dismisses
      it with:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;How long I continewed prisoneir, what torment I susteaned in the
            galaies, and what war the sobbes of my harte, is now no time
            to receat: This onlie I can nocht conceall, which mo than one
            have hard me say, when the body was far absent from Scotland,
            that my assured houp was, in oppin audience, to preache in Sanctandrois
            befoir I depairted this lyeff.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The prisoners were released from the galleys through the instrumentality
      of the English Government in the early months of 1549, and Knox reached
      England by the 7th of April. It was there that he began his real work
      as a preacher of the Reformation. He spent nearly five years as minister
      at Berwick, at Newcastle, and in London. He was twice offered preferment&mdash;the
      vacant bishopric of Rochester in 1552, and the vicarage of All Hallows
      in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span> Bread
      St., London, in the beginning of 1553. He refused both, and was actually
      summoned before the Privy Council to explain why he would not accept
      preferment.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> It
      is probable that he had something to do with the production of <i>The
      Book of Common Prayer and Administration of the Sacraments and other
      Rites and Ceremonies in the Church of England, 1552</i>, commonly called
      the <i>Second Prayer-Book</i> of King Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span> The
      rubric explaining kneeling at the partaking of the Holy Supper, or
      at least one sentence in it, is most probably due to his remonstrances
      or suggestions.<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> The
      accession of Mary Tudor to the throne closed his career in England;
      but he stuck to his work long after his companion preachers had abandoned
      it. He was in London, and had the courage to rebuke the rejoicings
      of the crowd at her entry into the capital&mdash;a fearless, outspoken
      man, who could always be depended on for doing what no one else dared.</p>
<p>Knox got safely across the Channel, travelled through France by ways unknown,
      and reached Geneva. He spent some time with Calvin, then went on to
      Zurich to see Bullinger. He appears to have been meditating deeply
      on the condition of Scotland and England, and propounded a set of questions
      to these divines which show that he was trying to formulate for himself
      the principles he afterwards asserted on the rights of subjects to
      restrain tyrannical sovereigns.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> The
      years 1554-58, with the exception of a brief visit to Scotland in the
      end of 1555, were spent on the Continent, but were important for his
      future work in Scotland. They witnessed the troubles in the Frankfurt
      congregation of English exiles, where Knox&rsquo;s broad-minded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg
      288]</a></span> toleration and straightforward action stands in noble
      contrast with the narrow-minded and crooked policy of his opponents.
      They were the time of his peaceful and happy ministrations among the
      refugees at Geneva. They made him familiar with the leading Protestants
      of France and of Switzerland, and taught him the inner political condition
      of the nations of Europe. They explain Knox&rsquo;s constant and accurate
      information in later years, when he seemed to learn about the doings
      of continental statesmen as early as Cecil, with all the resources
      of the English Foreign Office behind him. Above all, they made him
      see that, humanly speaking, the fate of the whole Reformation movement
      was bound up with an alliance between a Protestant England and a Protestant
      Scotland.</p>
<p>Knox returned to Scotland for a brief visit of about ten months (Sept.
      1555-July 1556). He exhorted those who visited him in his lodgings
      in Edinburgh, and made preaching tours, dispensing the Lord&rsquo;s Supper
      according to the Reformed rite on several occasions. He visited Dun,
      Calder House, Barr, Ayr, Ochiltree, and several other places, and was
      welcomed in the houses of many of the nobility. He left for Geneva
      in July, having found time to marry his first wife, Marjory Bowes,&mdash;<i>uxor
      suavissima</i>, and &ldquo;a wife whose like is not to be found everywhere,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> Calvin
      calls her,&mdash;and having put some additional force into the growing
      Protestantism of his native land. He tells us that most part of the
      gentlemen of the Mearns &ldquo;band thame selfis, to the uttermost of thare
      poweris, to manteane the trew preaching of the Evangell of Jesus Christ,
      as God should offer unto thame preacheris and opportunitie&rdquo;&mdash;whether
      by word of mouth or in writing, is not certain.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>
<p>In 1557 (Dec. 3rd) the Protestants of Scotland laid the foundations of
      a definite organisation. It took a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg
      289]</a></span> form familiar enough in the civil history of the country,
      where the turbulent character of the Scottish barons and the weakness
      of the central authority led to constant confederations to carry out
      with safety enterprises sometimes legal and sometimes outside the law.
      The confederates promised to assist each other in the work proposed,
      and to defend each other from the consequences following. Such agreements
      were often drafted in legal fashion by public notaries, and made binding
      by all forms of legal security known. The <i>Lords of the Congregation</i>,
      as they came to be called, followed a prevailing custom when they promised&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;Befoir the Majestie of God and His congregatioun, that we (be His
            grace) shall with all diligence continually apply our hole power,
            substance, and our verray lyves, to manteane, sett fordward,
            and establish the most blessed word of God and His Congregatioun;
            and shall laubour at our possibilitie to have faythfull Ministeris
            purely and trewlie to minister Christis Evangell and Sacramentes
            to His people.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This &ldquo;Band subscrived by the Lords&rdquo; was the first (if the promise made
      by the gentlemen of the Mearns be excepted) of the many Covenants famous
      in the history of the Church of Scotland Reformed.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> It
      was an old Scottish usage now impregnated with a new spiritual meaning,
      and become a public promise to God, after Old Testament fashion, to
      be faithful to His word and guidance.</p>
<p>This important act had immediate consequences. The confederated Lords
      sent letters to Knox, then at Geneva, and to Calvin, urging the return
      of the Scottish Reformer to his native land. They also passed two notable
      resolutions:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;First, It is thought expedient, devised and ordeaned that in all
            parochines of this Realme the Common Prayeris (probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg
            290]</a></span> the Second Prayer-Book of Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span>)<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> be

</blockquote>
<p>The Earl of Argyle set the example by maintaining John Douglas, and making
      him preach publicly in his mansion.</p>
<p>This conduct evidently alarmed the Queen Mother, who had been made Regent
      in 1554 (April 12th), and she attempted to stir the Primate to exercise
      his powers for the repression of heresy. The Archbishop wrote to Argyle
      urging him to dismiss Douglas, apologising at the same time for his
      interference by saying that the Queen wondered that he could &ldquo;thole&rdquo; persons
      with perverted doctrine within his diocese.</p>
<p>Another step in advance was taken some time in 1558, when it was resolved
      to give the <i>Congregation</i>, the whole company of those in Scotland
      who sincerely accepted the Evangelical Reformation, &ldquo;the face of a
      Church,&rdquo; by the creation and recognition of an authority which could
      exercise discipline. A number of elders were chosen
      &ldquo;by common election,&rdquo; to whom the whole of the brethren promised obedience.
      The lack of a publicly recognised ministry was supplied by laymen,
      who gave themselves to the work of exhortation; and at the head of
      them was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg
      291]</a></span> to be found Erskine of Dun. The first regularly constituted
      Reformed church in Scotland was in the town of Dundee.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>
<p>The organisation gave the Protestant leaders boldness, and, through Sir
      James Sandilands, they petitioned the Regent to permit them to worship
      publicly according to the Reformed fashion, and to reform the wicked
      lives of the clergy. This led to the offer of a compromise, which was
      at once rejected, as it would have compelled the Reformed to reverence
      the Mass, and to approve of prayers to the saints. The Queen Mother
      then permitted public worship, save in Leith and Edinburgh. The Lords
      of the Congregation next demanded a suspension of the laws which gave
      the clergy power to try and punish heresy, until a General Council,
      lawfully assembled, should decide upon points then debated in religion;
      and that all suspected of heresy should have a fair trial before
      &ldquo;temporal judges.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> When
      the Regent, who gave them
      &ldquo;amyable lookis and good wordes in aboundance,&rdquo; refused to allow their
      petition to come before the Estates, and kept it &ldquo;close in hir pocket,&rdquo; the
      Reformers resolved to go to Parliament directly with another petition,
      in which they declared that since they had not been able to secure
      a reformation, they had resolved to follow their own consciences in
      matters of religion; that they would defend themselves and all of their
      way of thinking if attacked; that if tumults arose in consequence,
      the blame was with those who refused a just reformation; and that in
      forwarding this petition they had nothing in view but the reformation
      of abuses in religion.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>
<p>Knox had been invited by the Earl of Glencairn, the Lords Erskine and
      Lorn, and James Stewart (afterwards the Earl of Moray), to return to
      Scotland in 1557.<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> He
      reached Dieppe in October, and found letters awaiting him which told
      him that the times were not ripe. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg
      292]</a></span> answer he sent spurred the Reforming lords to constitute
      the <i>Band</i> of December 1557. It was while he was at Dieppe, chafing
      at the news he had received, that he composed the violent treatise,
      entitled <i>The First Blast of the Trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment
      of Women</i><a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>&mdash;a
      book which did more to hamper his future than anything else. The state
      of things was exasperating to a man who longed to be at work in Scotland
      or England.
      &ldquo;Bloody&rdquo; Mary in England was hounding on her officials to burn Knox&rsquo;s
      co-religionists, and the Reformation, which had made so much progress
      under Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span>, seemed to be entirely
      overthrown; while Mary of Guise, the Queen Mother and Regent in Scotland,
      was inciting the unwilling Archbishop of St. Andrews to make use of
      his legatine and episcopal powers to repress the believers of his native
      land. But as chance would have it, Mary Tudor was dead before the pamphlet
      was widely known, and the Queen whom of all others he desired to conciliate
      was seated on the throne of England, and had made William Cecil, the
      staunchest of Protestants, her Secretary of State. She could scarcely
      avoid believing that the <i>Blast</i> was meant for her; and, even
      if not, it was based on such general principles that it might prove
      dangerous to one whose throne was still insecure. It is scarcely to
      be wondered at that the Queen never forgave the vehement writer, and
      that the <i>Blast</i> was a continual obstacle to a complete understanding
      between the Scottish Reformer and his English allies.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> If
      Knox would never confess publicly to queens, whether to Elizabeth Tudor
      or to Mary Stuart; that he had done wrong, he was ready to say to a
      friend whom he loved:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;My rude vehemencie and inconsidered affirmations, which may rather
            appear to procead from coler then of zeal and reason, I do not
            excuse.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></p>
<p>It was the worse for Knox and for Scotland, for the reign of women had
      begun. Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span>, Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span>,
      and Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> had passed away, and the
      destinies of Europe were to be in the hands of Elizabeth, Catherine
      de&rsquo; Medici, Mary Stuart, and Philip of Spain, the most felinely feminine
      of the four.</p>
<p>Events marched fast in Scotland after Knox returned in the early summer
      of 1559. The Queen Regent and the Lords of the Congregation were facing
      each other, determined on a trial of strength. Knox reached Edinburgh
      on May 2nd, 1559, and hurried on to Dundee, where the Reformed had
      gathered in some force. They had resolved to support their brethren
      in maintaining public worship according to the usages of the Reformed
      Church, and in repressing &ldquo;idolatrie&rdquo; in all towns where a majority
      of the inhabitants had declared for the Reformed religion. The Regent
      threw down the gauntlet by summoning the preachers to appear before
      her, and by inhibiting their preaching. The Lords took it up by resolving
      that they would answer the summons and appear along with their preachers.
      A letter was addressed to the Regent (May 6th, 1559) by &ldquo;The professouris
      of Christis Evangell in the realme of Scotland.&rdquo; It was an admirable
      statement of the principles of the Scottish Reformation, and may be
      thus summarised:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;It records the hope, once entertained by the writers, that God
            would make her the instrument of setting up and maintaining his
            Word and true worship, of defending his congregation, and of
            downputting all idolatry, abomination, and superstition in the
            realm; it expresses their grief on learning that she was determined
            to do the very opposite; it warns her against crossing the bounds
            of her own office, and usurping a power in Christ&rsquo;s kingdom which
            did not belong to her; it distinguishes clearly between the civil
            jurisdiction and the spiritual; it asks her to recall her letters
            inhibiting God&rsquo;s messengers; it insists that His message ought
            to be received even though the speaker should lack the ordinary
            vocation; it claims that the ministers who had been inhibited
            were sent by God, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg
            294]</a></span> were also called according to Scriptural order;
            it points out that her commands must be disobeyed if contrary
            to God&rsquo;s, and that the enemies were craftily inducing her to
            command unjust things so that the professors, when they disobeyed,
            might be condemned for sedition and rebellion; it pled with her
            to have pity on those who were seeking the glory of God and her
            true obedience; it declared that, by God&rsquo;s help, they would go
            forward in the way they had begun, that they would receive and
            assist His ministers and Word, and that they would never join
            themselves again to the abominations they had forsaken, though
            all the powers on earth should command them to do so; it conveyed
            their humble submission to her, in all obedience due to her in
            peace, in war, in body, in goods and in lands; and it closed
            with the prayer that the eternal God would instruct, strengthen,
            and lead her by His Spirit in the way that was acceptable to
            Him.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then began a series of trials of strength in which the Regent had generally
      the better, because she was supplied with disciplined troops from France,
      which were more than a match for the feudal levies of the Lords of
      the Congregation. The uprising of the people against the Regent and
      the Prelates was characterised, as in France and the Low Countries,
      with an outbreak of iconoclasm which did no good to the Protestant
      cause. In the three countries the &ldquo;raschall multitude&rdquo; could not be
      restrained by the exhortation of the preachers nor by the commandment
      of the magistrates from destroying &ldquo;the places of idolatrie.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>
<p>From the beginning, Knox had seen that the Reformers had small hope of
      ultimate success unless they were aided from England; and he was encouraged
      to expect help because he knew that the salvation of Protestant England
      lay in its support of the Lords of the Congregation in Scotland.</p>
<p>The years from 1559 to 1567 were the most critical in the whole history
      of the Reformation. The existence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg
      295]</a></span> of the Protestantism of all Europe was involved in
      the struggle in Scotland; and for the first and perhaps last time in
      her history the eyes that had the furthest vision, whether in Rome,
      for centuries the citadel of medi&aelig;valism, or in Geneva, the stronghold
      of Protestantism, were turned towards the little backward northern
      kingdom. They watched the birth-throes of a new nation, a British nation
      which was coming into being. Two peoples, long hereditary foes, were
      coalescing; the Romanists in England recognised the Scottish Queen
      as their legitimate sovereign, and the Protestants in Scotland looked
      for aid to their brethren in England. The question was: Would the new
      nation accept the Reformed religion, or would the reaction triumph?
      If Knox and the Congregation gained the upper hand in Scotland, and
      if Cecil was able to guide England in the way he meant to lead it (and
      the two men were necessary to each other, and knew it), then the Reformation
      was safe. If Scotland could be kept for France and the Roman Church,
      and its Romanist Queen make good her claim to the English throne, then
      the Reformation would be crushed not merely within Great Britain, but
      in Germany and the Low Countries also. So thought the politicians,
      secular and ecclesiastical, in Rome and Geneva, in Paris, Madrid, and
      in London. The European situation had been summed up by Cecil: &ldquo;The
      Emperor is aiming at the sovereignty of Europe, which he cannot obtain
      without the suppression of the Reformed religion, and, unless he crushes
      England, he cannot crush the Reformation.&rdquo;
      In this peril a Scotland controlled by the Guises would have been fatal
      to the existence of the Reformation.</p>
<p>In 1559 the odds seemed in favour of reaction, if only its supporters
      were whole-hearted enough to put aside for the time national rivalries.
      The Treaty of Cateau-Cambr&eacute;sis, concluded scarcely a month before
      Knox reached Scotland (April 1559), had secret clauses which bound
      the Kings of France and Spain to crush the Protestantism of Europe,
      in terms which made the young Prince of Orange, when he learned them,
      vow silently to devote his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg
      296]</a></span> life to protect his fellow-countrymen and drive the &ldquo;scum
      of the Spaniards&rdquo; out of the Netherlands. Henry <span class="smcap">II.</span> of
      France, with his Edict of Chateaubriand and his <i>Chambre Ardente</i>,
      with the Duke of Guise and the Cardinal Lorraine to counsel him, and
      Diane of Poitiers to keep him up to the mark, was doing his best to
      exterminate the Protestants of France. Dr. Christopher Mundt kept reporting
      to Queen Elizabeth and her Minister the symptoms of a general combination
      against the Protestants of Europe&mdash;symptoms ranging from a proposed
      conquest of Denmark to the Emperor&rsquo;s forbidding members of his Household
      to attend Protestant services.<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> Throckmorton
      wrote almost passionately from Paris urging Cecil to support the Scottish
      Lords of the Congregation; and even Dr. Mundt in Strassburg saw that
      the struggle in Scotland was the most important fact in the European
      situation.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>
<p>Yet it was difficult for Cecil to send the aid which Knox and the Scottish
      Protestants needed sorely. It meant that the sovereign of one country
      aided men of another country who were <i>de jure</i> rebels against
      their own sovereign. It seemed a hazardous policy in the case of a
      Queen like Elizabeth, who was not yet freed from the danger arising
      from rebellious subjects. There was France, with which England had
      just made peace. Cecil had difficulties with Elizabeth. She did not
      like Calvin himself. She had no sympathy with his theology, which,
      with its mingled sob and hosanna, stirred the hearts of oppressed peoples.
      There was Knox and his <i>Blast</i>, to say nothing of his appealing
      to the commonalty of his country. &ldquo;God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg
      297]</a></span> keep us from such visitations as Knockes hath attempted
      in Scotland; the people to be orderers of things!&rdquo; wrote Dr. Parker
      to Cecil on the 6th of November.<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> Yet
      Cecil knew&mdash;no man better&mdash;that if the Lords of the Congregation
      failed there was little hope for a Protestant England, and that Elizabeth&rsquo;s
      crown and Dr. Parker&rsquo;s mitre depended on the victory of Knox in Scotland.</p>
<p>He watched the struggle across the border. He had made up his mind as
      early as July 8th, 1559, that assistance must be given to the Lords
      of the Congregation &ldquo;with all fair promises first, next with money,
      and last with arms.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> The
      second stage of his programme was reached in November; and, two days
      before the Archbishop of Canterbury was piously invoking God&rsquo;s help
      to keep Knox&rsquo;s influences out of England, Cecil had resolved to send
      money to Scotland and to entrust its distribution to Knox. The memorandum
      runs: Knox to be a counsel with the payments, to see that they be employed
      to the common action.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>
<p>The third stage&mdash;assistance with arms&mdash;came sooner than might
      have been expected. The condition of France became more favourable.
      Henry <span class="smcap">II.</span> had died (July 10th, 1559), and
      the Guises ruled France through their niece Mary and her sickly devoted
      husband. But the Bourbon Princes and many of the higher nobles did
      not take kindly to the sudden rise of a family which had been French
      for only two generations, and the easiest way to annoy them was to
      favour publicly or secretly &ldquo;those of the religion.&rdquo;
      There was unrest in France. &ldquo;Beat the iron while it is hot,&rdquo; Throckmorton
      wrote from Paris; &ldquo;their fair flatterings and sweet language are only
      to gain time.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> Cecil
      struck. He had a sore battle with his royal mistress, but he won.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> An
      arrangement was come to between England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg
      298]</a></span> and the Lords of the Congregation acting on behalf &ldquo;of
      the second person of the realm of Scotland&rdquo; (Treaty of Berwick, May
      10th, 1560).<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> An
      English fleet entered the Firth of Forth; an English army beleaguered
      the French troops in Leith Fort; and the end of it was that France
      was obliged to let go its hold on Scotland, and never thoroughly recovered
      it (Treaty of Edinburgh, July 6th, 1560).<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> The
      great majority of the Scottish people saw in the English victory only
      their deliverance from French tyranny, and for the first time a conquering
      English army left the Scottish soil followed by blessings and not curses.
      The Scottish Liturgy, which had contained <i>Prayers used in the Churches
      of Scotland in the time of their persecution by the Frenchmen</i>,
      was enriched by a <i>Thanksgiving unto God after our deliverance from
      the tyranny of the Frenchmen; with prayers made for the continuance
      of the peace betwixt the realms of England and Scotland</i>, which
      contained the following petition:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;And seeing that when we by our owne power were altogether unable
            to have freed ourselves from the tyranny of strangers, and from
            the bondage and thraldome pretended against us, Thou of thyne
            especial goodnes didst move the hearts of our neighbours (of
            whom we deserved no such favour) to take upon them the common
            burthen with us, and for our deliverance not only to spend the
            lives of many, but also to hazards the estate and tranquillity
            of their Realme and commonwealth: Grant unto us, O Lord, that
            with such reverence we may remember thy benefits received that
            after this in our defaute we never enter into hostilitie against
            the Realme and nation of England.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Regent had died during the course of the hostilities, and Cecil, following
      and improving upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg
      299]</a></span> wise policy of Protector Somerset, left it entirely
      to the Scots to settle their own affairs.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>
<p>Now or never was the opportunity for Knox and the Lords of the Congregation.
      They had not been idle during the months since Knox had arrived in
      Scotland. They had strengthened the ties uniting them by three additional <i>Bands</i>.
      At a meeting of the Congregation of the West with the Congregations
      of Fife, Perth, Dundee, Angus, Mearns, and Montrose, held in Perth
      (May 31st, 1559), they had covenanted to spare neither</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;labouris, goodis, substancis, bodyis, and lives, in manteaning
            the libertie of the haill Congregatioun and everie member thairof,
            aganis whatsomevir power that shall intend trubill for the caus
            of religion.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They had renewed this <i>Band</i> in Edinburgh on July 13th; and at Stirling
      (Aug. 1st) they had covenanted,</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;that nane of us sall in tymeis cuming pas to the Quenis Grace Dowriare,
            to talk or commun with hir for any letter without consent of
            the rest and commone consultatioun.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They had the bitter satisfaction of knowing that although the French troops
      and officers of the Regent were too strong for them in the field, the
      insolence and rapine of these foreigners was rousing all ranks and
      classes in Scotland to see that their only deliverance lay in the English
      alliance and the triumph of the Reformation. The <i>Band</i> of 1560
      (April 27th) included, with &ldquo;the nobilitie, barronis, and gentilmen
      professing Chryst Jesus in Scotland ... dyveris utheris that joyint
      with us, for expelling of the French army: amangis quham the Erle of
      Huntlie was principall.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>
<p>The Estates or Parliament met in Edinburgh on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg
                  300]</a></span> July 10th, 1560. Neither the French nor
                  the English soldiers had left; so they adjourned to August
                  1st, and again to the 8th.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile Knox and the Congregation were busy. The Reformer excelled himself
      in the pulpit of St. Giles&rsquo;, lecturing daily on the Book of the Prophet
      Haggai (on the building of the Temple)&mdash;&ldquo;a doctrine proper for
      the time.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> Randolph
      wrote to Cecil, Aug. 15th:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;Sermons are daylie, and greate audience; though dyvers of the nobles
            present ar not resolved in religion, yet do thei repayre to the

</blockquote>
<p>The Congregation held a great thanksgiving service in St. Giles&rsquo;; and
      after it arranged for eight fully constituted churches, and appointed
      five superintendents in matters of religion.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> They
      also prepared a petition for Parliament asking for a settlement of
      the religious question in the way they desired.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> At
      the request of the Estates or Parliament, Knox and five companions
      prepared <i>The Confessioun of Faith professit and belevit be the Protestantis
      within the Realme of Scotland</i>, which was ratified and approved
      as &ldquo;hailsome and sound doctrine, groundit upoun the infallible trewth
      of Godis Word.&rdquo; It was afterwards issued by the Estates as the &ldquo;summe
      of that doctrin quhilk we professe, and for the quhilk we haif sustenit
      infamy and daingear.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> Seven
      days later (Aug. 24th), the Estates decreed that &ldquo;the Bischope of Rome
      have na jurisdictioun nor authoritie in this Realme in tymes cuming&rdquo;;
      they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span> annulled
      all Acts of previous Parliaments which were contrary to the Confession
      of Faith; and they forbade the saying, hearing, or being present at
      Mass, under penalty of confiscation of goods and bodily punishment
      at the discretion of the magistrates for the first offence, of banishment
      for the second, and of death for the third.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> These
      severe penalties, however, were by no means rigidly enforced. Lesley
      (Roman Catholic Bishop of Ross) says in his <i>History</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;The clemency of the heretic nobles must not be left unmentioned,
            since at that time they exiled few Catholic on the score of religion,
            imprisoned fewer, and put none to death.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One thing still required to be done&mdash;to draft a constitution for
      the new Protestant Church. The work was committed to the same ministers
      who had compiled the Confession. They had been asked to prepare it
      as early as April 29th, and they had it ready for the Lords of the
      Congregation within a month. It was not approved by the Estates; but
      was ordered to be submitted to the next general meeting, and was meanwhile
      translated into Latin, to be sent to Calvin, Viret, and Beza in Geneva.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> The
      delay seemed to some to arise from the unwillingness of many of the
      lords to see &ldquo;their carnal liberty and worldly commoditie impaired&rdquo;;<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> but
      another cause was also at work. Cecil evidently wished that the Church
      in Scotland should be uniform with the Church in England, and had instructed
      Randolph to press this question of uniformity. It was a favourite idea
      with statesmen of both countries&mdash;pressed on Scotland by England
      during the reigns of James <span class="smcap">I.</span> and Charles <span class="smcap">I.</span>,
      and by Scotland on England in the Solemn League and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg
      302]</a></span> Covenant. Randolph was wise enough to see that such
      uniformity was an impossibility.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a></p>
<p><i>The Confession of the Faith and Doctrine, Believed and Professed by
            the Protestants of Scotland</i>, was translated into Latin, and,
            under the title <i>Confessio Scoticana</i>, occupies an honoured
            place in the collections of the creeds of the Reformed Churches.
            It remained the symbol of the Church of Scotland during the first
            stormy century of its existence. It was displaced by the Westminster
            Confession in 1647, only on the understanding that the later
            document was &ldquo;in nothing contrary&rdquo; to the former; and continued
            authoritative long after that date.<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> Drawn
            up in haste by a small number of theologians, it is more sympathetic
            and human than most creeds, and has commended itself to many
            who object to the impersonal logic of the Westminster Confession.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> The
            first sentence of the preface gives the tone to the whole:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;Lang have we thirsted, dear Brethren, to have notified to the Warld
            the Sum of that Doctrine quhilk we professe, and for quhilk we
            have susteined Infamie and Danger; Bot sik has bene the Rage
            of Sathane againis us, and againis Christ Jesus his eternal Veritie
            latlie now againe born amangst us, that to this daie na Time

</blockquote>
<p>The preface also puts more clearly than any similiar document save the
      First Confession of Basel the reverence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg
      303]</a></span> felt by the early Reformers for the Word of God and
      the renunciation of any claim to infallibility of interpretation:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;Protestand that gif onie man will note in this our confessioun
            onie Artickle repugnand to Gods halie word, that it wald pleis
            him of his gentleness and for christian charities sake to admonish
            us of the same in writing; and we upon our honoures and fidelitie,
            be Gods grace do promise unto him satisfaction fra the mouth
            of God, that is fra his haly scriptures, or else reformation
            of that quhilk he sal prove to be amisse.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Confession itself contains the truths common to the Reformed creeds
      of the Reformation. It contains all the &#338;cumenical doctrines,
      as they have been called&mdash;that is, the truths taught in the early &#338;cumenical
      Councils, and embodied in the Apostles&rsquo; and Nicene Creeds; and adds
      those doctrines of grace, of pardon, and of enlightenment through Word
      and Spirit which were brought into special prominence by the Reformation
      revival of religion. The Confession is more remarkable for quaint suggestiveness
      of titles than for any special peculiarity of doctrine. Thus the doctrine
      of revelation is defined by itself, apart from the doctrine of Scripture,
      under the title of &ldquo;The Revelation of the Promise.&rdquo; Election is treated
      according to the view of earlier Calvinism as a means of grace, and
      an evidence of the &ldquo;invincible power&rdquo; of the Godhead in salvation.
      The &ldquo;notes by which the true Kirk is discerned from the false&rdquo; are
      said to be the true preaching of the Word of God, the right administration
      of the sacraments, and ecclesiastical discipline rightly administered.
      The authority of Scriptures is said to come from God, and to depend
      neither &ldquo;on man nor angels&rdquo;; and the Church knows them to be true,
      because &ldquo;the true kirk always heareth and obeyeth the voice of her
      own spouse and pastor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Randolph says in a letter to Cecil (September 7th, 1560) that before the
      Confession was publicly read it was revised by Lethington and Lord
      James Stewart, who &ldquo;dyd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg
      304]</a></span> mytigate the austeritie of maynie wordes and sentences,&rdquo;
      and that a certain article which dealt with the &ldquo;dysobediens that subjects
      owe unto their magistrates&rdquo; was advised to be left out.<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> Thus
      amended it was read over, and then re-read article by article in the
      Estates, and passed without alteration,<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>&mdash;&ldquo;no

      it was read before the Estates:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;Maynie offered to sheede ther blude in defence of the same. The
            old Lord of Lynsay, as grave and goodly a man as ever I sawe,
            said, &lsquo;I have lyved maynie yeres, I am the eldest in thys Compagnie

</blockquote>
<p>A copy was sent to Cecil, and Maitland of Lethington assured him that
      if there was anything in the Confession of Faith which the English
      Minister misliked, &ldquo;It may eyther be changed (if the mater so permit)
      or at least in some thyng qualifieed&rdquo;; which shows the anxiety of the
      Scots to keep step with their English allies.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>
<p>The authors of the Confession were asked to draw up a short statement
      showing how a Reformed Church could best be governed. The result was
      the remarkable document which was afterwards called the <i>First Book
      of Discipline</i>, or <i>the Policie and Discipline of the Church</i>.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> It
      provided for the government of the Church by kirk-sessions, synods,
      and general assemblies; and recognised as office-bearers in the Church,
      ministers, teachers, elders, deacons, superintendents, and readers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg
      305]</a></span> The authors of this Book of Discipline professed to
      go directly to Scripture for the outlines of the system of Church government
      which they advised their countrymen to adopt, and their profession
      was undoubtedly sincere and likewise just. They were, however, all
      of them men in sympathy with Calvin, and had had personal intercourse
      with the Protestants of France. Their form of government is clearly
      inspired by Calvin&rsquo;s ideas as stated in his <i>Institution</i>, and
      follows closely the Ecclesiastical Ordinances of the French Church.
      The offices of superintendent and reader were added to the usual threefold
      or fourfold Presbyterian form of government. The former was due to
      the unsettled state of the country and the scarcity of Protestant pastors.
      The <i>Superintendents</i> took charge of districts corresponding not
      very exactly with the Episcopal dioceses, and were ordered to make
      annual reports to the General Assembly of the ecclesiastical and religious
      state of their provinces, and to preach in the various churches in
      their district. The <i>Readers</i> owed their existence to the small
      number of Protestant pastors, to the great importance attached by the
      early Scottish Reformers to an educated ministry, and also to the difficulty
      of procuring funds for the support of pastors in every parish. They
      were of two classes&mdash;those of a higher grade, who were permitted
      to deliver addresses and who were called <i>Exhorters</i>; and those
      of the lower grade, whose duty it was to read &ldquo;distinctly&rdquo; the Common
      Prayers and the Scriptures. Both classes were expected to teach the
      younger children. <i>Exhorters</i> who studied theology diligently
      and satisfied the synod of their learning could rise to be ministers.
      The Book of Discipline contains a chapter on the patrimony of the Church
      which urges the necessity of preserving monies possessed by the Church
      for the maintenance of religion, the support of education, and the
      help of the poor. The presence of this chapter prevented the book being
      accepted by the Estates in the same way as the Confession of Faith.
      The barons, greater and lesser, who sat there had in too many cases
      appropriated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg
      306]</a></span> the &ldquo;patrimony of the Kirk&rdquo; to their own private uses,
      and were unwilling to sign a document which condemned their conduct.
      The Book of Discipline approved by the General Assembly, and signed
      by a large number of the nobles and burgesses, never received the legal
      sanction accorded to the Confession.</p>
<p>The General Assembly of the Reformed Church of Scotland met for the first
      time in 1560; and thereafter, in spite of the struggle in which the
      Church was involved, meetings were held generally twice a year, sometimes
      oftener, and the Church was organised for active work.</p>
<p>A third book, variously called <i>The Book of Common Order</i>,<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> <i>The
            Order of Geneva</i>, and now frequently <i>Knox&rsquo;s Liturgy</i>,
            was a directory for the public worship and services of the Church.
            It was usually bound up with a metrical version of the Psalms,
            and is often spoken of as the <i>Psalm Book</i>.</p>
<p><i>Calvin&rsquo;s Catechism</i> was translated and ordered to be used for the
      instruction of the youth in the faith. Later, the <i>Heidelberg Catechism</i> was
      translated and annotated for the same purpose. They were both superseded
      by <i>Craig&rsquo;s Catechism</i>, which in its turn gave way to the <i>Larger</i> and <i>Shorter
      Catechisms</i> of the Westminster Divines.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>
<p>The democratic ideas of Presbyterianism, enforced by the practical necessity
      of trusting in the people, made the Scotch Reformers pay great attention
      to education. All the leaders of the Reformation, whether in Germany,
      France, or Holland, had felt the importance of enlightening the commonalty;
      but perhaps Scotland and Holland were the two countries where the attempt
      was most successful. The education of the people was no new thing in
      Scotland; and although in the troublous times before and during the
      Reformation high schools had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg
      307]</a></span> disappeared and the Universities had decayed, still
      the craving for learning had not altogether died out. Knox and his
      friend George Buchanan had a magnificent scheme of endowing schools
      in every parish, high schools or colleges in all important towns, and
      of increasing the power and influence of the Universities. Their scheme,
      owing to the greed of the Barons, who had seized the Church property,
      was little more than a devout imagination; but it laid hold on the
      mind of Scotland, and the lack of endowments was more than compensated
      by the craving of the people for education. The three Universities
      of St. Andrews, Glasgow, and Aberdeen took new life, and a fourth,
      the University of Edinburgh, was founded. Scotch students who had been
      trained in the continental schools of learning, and who had embraced
      the Reformed faith, were employed to superintend the newly-organised
      educational system of the country, and the whole organisation was brought
      into sympathy with the everyday life of the people by the preference
      given to day schools over boarding schools, and by a system of inspection
      by the most pious and learned men in each circle of parishes. Knox
      also was prepared to order compulsory attendance at school on the part
      of two classes of society, the upper and the lower&mdash;the middle
      class he thought might be trusted to its own natural desire for learning;
      and he wished to see the State so exercise power and patronage as to
      lay hold on all youths
      &ldquo;of parts&rdquo; and compel them to proceed to the high schools and Universities,
      that the commonwealth might get the greatest good of their service.</p>
<p>The form of Church government given in the <i>First Book of Discipline</i> represented
      rather an outline requiring to be filled in than a picture of what
      actually existed for many a year after 1560. It provided for a form
      of Church government by ecclesiastical councils rising from the Session
      of the individual congregation up to a National Assembly, and its first
      requisite was a fully organised church in every parish ruled by a minister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg
      308]</a></span> with his Session or council of Elders and his body
      of Deacons. But there was a great lack of men having the necessary
      amount of education to be ordained as ministers, and consequently there
      were few fully equipped congregations. The first court in existence
      was the Kirk-Session; it was in being in every organised congregation.
      The second in order of time was the General Assembly. Its first meeting
      was in Edinburgh, Dec. 20th, 1560. Forty-two members were present,
      of whom only six were ministers. These were the small beginnings from
      which it grew. The Synods came into existence later. At first they
      were yearly gatherings of the ministry of the Superintendent&rsquo;s district,
      to which each congregation within the district was asked to send an
      Elder and a Deacon. The Court of the Presbytery came latest into existence;
      it had its beginnings in the &ldquo;weekly exercise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The work had been rapidly done. Barely a year had elapsed between the
      return of Knox to Scotland and the establishment of the Reformed religion
      by the Estates. Calvin wrote from Geneva (Nov. 8th, 1559):</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;As we wonder at success incredible in so short a time, so also
            we give great thanks to God, whose special blessing here shines
            forth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Knox himself, writing from the midst of the battle, says:<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;We doe nothing but goe about Jericho, blowing with trumpets, as
            God giveth strength, hoping victorie by his power alone.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But dangers had been imminent; shot at through his window, deadly ambushes
      set, and the man&rsquo;s powers taxed almost beyond endurance:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;In twenty-four hours I have not four free to naturall rest and
            ease of this wicked carcass ... I have nead of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg
            309]</a></span> good and an assured horse, for great watch is
            laid for my apprehension, and large money promissed till any
            that shall kyll me.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the victory had been won, it was not secured. The sovereigns Mary and
      Francis had refused to ratify the Acts of their Estates; and it was
      not until Mary was deposed in 1567 that the Acts of the Estates of
      1560 were legally placed on the Statute Book of Scotland. Francis <span class="smcap">II.</span> died
      in 1560 (Dec. 5th), and Mary the young and widowed Queen returned to
      her native land (Aug. 19th, 1561). Her coming was looked forward to
      with dread by the party of the Reformation.</p>
<p>There was abundant reason for alarm. Mary was the Stuart Queen; she represented
      France, the old hereditary ally; she had been trained from childhood
      by a consummate politician and deadly enemy of the Reformation, her
      uncle the Cardinal of Lorraine, to be his instrument to win back Scotland
      and England to the deadliest type of Romanism. She was a lovely creature,
      and was, besides, gifted with a power of personal fascination greater
      than her physical charms, and such as no other woman of her time possessed;
      she had a sweet caressing voice, beautiful hands; and not least, she
      had a gift of tears at command. She had been brought up at a Court
      where women were taught to use all such charms to win men for political
      ends. The <i>Escadron volant de la Reine</i> had not come into existence
      when Mary left France, but its recruits were ready, and some of them
      had been her companions. She had made it clearly understood that she
      meant to overthrow the Reformation in Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> Her
      unscrupulous character was already known to Knox and the other Protestant
      leaders. Nine days before her marriage she had signed deeds guaranteeing
      the ancient liberties and independence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg
      310]</a></span> Scotland; six days after her marriage she and her husband
      had appended their signatures to the same deeds; but twenty days before
      her wedding she had secretly signed away these very liberties, and
      had made Scotland a mere appanage of France.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> They
      suspected that the party in France whose figure-head she was, would
      stick at no crime to carry out their designs, and had shown what they
      were ready to do by poisoning four of the Scotch Commissioners sent
      to Paris for their young Queen&rsquo;s wedding, because they refused to allow
      Francis to be immediately crowned King of Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> They
      knew how apt a pupil she had already shown herself in their school,
      when she led her boy husband and her ladies for a walk round the Castle
      of Amboise, to see the bodies of dozens of Protestants hung from lintels
      and turrets, and to contemplate &ldquo;the fair clusters of grapes which
      the grey stones had produced.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>
<p>It was scarcely wonderful that Lord James, Morton, and Lethington, were
      it not for obedience&rsquo; sake, &ldquo;cared not thoughe theie never saw her
      face,&rdquo; and felt that there was no safety for them but in Elizabeth&rsquo;s
      protection. As for Knox, we are told: &ldquo;Mr. Knox is determined to abide
      the uttermost, and others will not leave him till God have taken his
      life and theirs together.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> What
      use might she not make of these fascinations of hers on the vain, turbulent
      nobles of Scotland? Is it too much to say that but for the passionate
      womanly impulse&mdash;so like a Stuart<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>&mdash;which
      made her fling herself first into the arms of Darnley and then of Bothwell,
      and but for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg
      311]</a></span> Knox, she might have succeeded in re-establishing Popery
      in Scotland and in reducing Protestant England?</p>
<p>Cecil himself was not without his fears, and urged the Protestants in
      Scotland to stand firm. Randolph&rsquo;s answer shows how much he trusted
      Knox&rsquo;s tenacity, however much he might sometimes deprecate his violence:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;Where your honour exhortethe us to stowteness, I assure you the
            voyce of one man is hable in one hower to put more lyf in us
            than five hundred trompettes contynually blusteringe in our eares.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was able to write after Mary&rsquo;s arrival:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;She (Mary) was four days without Mass; the next Sunday after arrival
            she had it said in her chapel by a French priest. There were
            at it besides her uncles and her own Household, the Earle of
            Montrose, Lord Graham ... the rest were at Mr. Knox sermon, as
            great a number as ever was any day.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s advisers, her uncles, knew how dangerous the state of Scotland
      was for their designs, and counselled her to temporise and gradually
      win over the leading Reforming nobles to her side. The young Queen
      entered on her task with some zest. She insisted on having Mass for
      her own household; but she would maintain, she promised, the laws which
      had made the Mass illegal in Scotland; and it says a great deal for
      her powers of fascination and dissimulation that there was scarcely
      one of the Reforming nobles that she did not win over to believe in
      her sincerity at one time or another, and that even the sagacious Randolph
      seemed for a time to credit that she meant what she said.<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> Knox
      alone in Scotland read her character and paid unwilling tribute to
      her abilities from his first interview with her.<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></p>
<p>He saw that she had been thoroughly trained by her uncles, and especially
      by the Cardinal of Lorraine, and that it was hopeless to expect anything
      like fair dealing from her:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;In verry dead hir hole proceadings do declayr that the Cardinalles
            lessons ar so deaplie prented in hir heart, that the substance
            and the qualitie ar liek to perische together. 1 wold be glaid
            to be deceaved, but I fear I shall not. In communication with
            her, I espyed such craft as I have not found in such aige.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maitland of Lethington thought otherwise. Writing to Cecil (Oct. 25th,
      1561) he says:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;You know the vehemency of Mr. Knox spreit, which cannot be brydled....
            I wold wishe he shold deale with her more gently, <i>being a
            young princess unpersuaded</i>.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was thought that Mary might be led to adopt the Reformation if she
      were only tenderly guided. When Mary&rsquo;s private correspondence is read,
      when the secret knowledge which her co-religionists abroad had of her
      designs is studied and known, it can be seen how true was Knox&rsquo;s reading
      of her character and of her intentions.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> He
      stood firm, almost alone at times among the leading men, but faithfully
      supported by the commons of Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a></p>
<p>Then began the struggle between the fascinating Queen, Mary Stuart, one
      of the fairest flowers of the French Renaissance, and the unbending
      preacher, trained in the sternest school of the Reformation movement&mdash;a
      struggle which was so picturesque, in which the two opponents had each
      such strongly marked individuality, and in which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg
      313]</a></span> accessories were so dramatic, that the spectator insensibly
      becomes absorbed in the personal side of the conflict, and is tempted
      to forget that it was part of a Revolution which was convulsing the
      whole of middle and western Europe.</p>
<p>A good deal has been written about the rudeness with which Knox assailed
      Mary in public and in private, and his conversations with her are continually
      referred to but seldom quoted in full. It is forgotten that it was
      Mary who wished to try her gifts of fascination on the preacher, just
      as Catherine de&rsquo; Medici tried to charm de B&egrave;ze before Poissy;
      that Knox never sought an interview; that he never approached the Court
      unless he was summoned by the sovereign to her presence; that he was
      deferential as a subject should be; and it was only when he was compelled
      by Mary herself to speak on themes for which he was ready to lay down
      his life that he displayed a sternness which monarchs seldom experience
      in those to whom they give audience. What makes these interviews stand
      forth in history is that they exhibit the first clash of autocratic
      kingship and the hitherto unknown power of the people. It was an age
      in which sovereigns were everywhere gaining despotic power, when the
      might of feudal barons was being broken, when the commonalty was dumb.
      A young Queen, whose training from childhood had stamped indelibly
      on her character that kingship meant the possession of unlimited autocratic
      privileges before which everything must give way, who had seen that
      none in France had dared dispute the will of her sickly, dull boy-husband
      simply because he was King, was suddenly confronted by something above
      and beyond her comprehension:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What have ye to do,&rsquo; said sche, &lsquo;with my marriage? Or what ar
            ye within this Commounwealth?&rsquo; &lsquo;<i>A subject borne within the
            same</i>,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;Madam. And albeit I neather be Erle, Lord,
            nor Barroun within it, yitt hes God maid me (how abject that
            ever I be in your eyes) a profitable member within the same.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></p>
<p>Modern democracy came into being in that answer. It is curious to see
      how this conflict between autocratic power and the civil and religious
      rights of the people runs through all the interviews between Mary and
      Knox, and was, in truth, the question of questions between them.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>
<p>It is unnecessary to tell the story of the seven years of struggle between
      1560 and 1567. In the end, Mary was imprisoned in Lochleven Castle,
      deposed, and her infant son, James <span class="smcap">VI.</span>,
      was placed on the throne. Lord James Stewart, Earl of Moray, was made
      Regent. The Estates or Parliament again voted the Confession of Faith,
      and engrossed it in their Acts. The Regent, acting for the sovereign,
      signed the Acts. The Confession thus became part of the law of the
      land, and the Reformed Church was legally recognised in Scotland.</p>

<h2><i>THE REFORMATION IN ENGLAND</i></h2>
<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h3>THE CHURCH OF HENRY VIII.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></h3>
<p>The Church and people of England broke away from the medi&aelig;val papal
      ecclesiastical system in a manner so exceptional, that the rupture
      had not very much in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg
      316]</a></span> common with the contemporary movements in France and
      Germany. Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> destroyed the papal
      supremacy, spiritual and temporal, within the land which he governed;
      he cut the bands which united the Church of England with the great
      Western Church ruled over by the Bishop of Rome; he built up what may
      be called a kingly papacy on the ruins of the jurisdiction of the Pope.
      His starting-point was a quarrel with the Pope, who refused to divorce
      him from Catharine of Aragon.</p>
<p>It would be a mistake, however, to think that Henry&rsquo;s eagerness to be
      divorced from Catharine accounts for the English Reformation. No king,
      however despotic, could have forced on such a revolution unless there
      was much in the life of the people that reconciled them to the change,
      and evidence of this is abundantly forthcoming.</p>
<p>There was a good deal of <i>heresy</i>, so called, in England long before
      Luther&rsquo;s voice had been heard in Germany. Men maintained that the tithes
      were exactions of covetous priests, and were not sanctioned by the
      law of God; they protested against the hierarchical constitution of
      the medi&aelig;val Church; they read the Scriptures, and attended services
      in the vernacular; and they scoffed at the authority of the Church
      and attacked some of its doctrines. Lollardy had never died out in
      England, and Lollardy was simply the English form of that passive protest
      against the medi&aelig;val Church which under various names had maintained
      itself in France, Germany, and Bohemia for centuries in spite of persecution.
      Foxe&rsquo;s <i>Acts and Monuments</i> show that there was a fairly active
      repression of so-called heresy in England before Luther&rsquo;s days, and
      his accounts are confirmed by the State Papers of the period. In 1511,
      Andreas Ammonius, the Latin secretary of Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>,
      writing to Erasmus, says that wood has grown scarce and dear because

      in 1533, More, writing to Erasmus, calls Tyndale and his sympathisers

      engaged as early as 1518 in composing a book against heresy and vindicating
      the claims of the Roman See, which in its first inception could scarcely
      be directed against Luther, and probably dealt with the views of home
      heretics.<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> Some
      modern historians are inclined to find a strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg
      318]</a></span> English revolt against Rome native to the soil and
      borrowing little or nothing from Luther, which they believe to have
      been the initial force at work in shaping the English Reformation.
      Mr. Pollard points out that in many particulars this Reformation followed
      the lines laid down by Wiclif. Its leaders, like Wiclif, denounced
      the Papal Supremacy on the ground of the political injury it did to
      the English people; declaimed against the sloth, immorality, and wealth
      of the English ecclesiastics; advocated a preaching ministry; and looked
      to the secular power to restrain the vices and reform the manners of
      the clergy, and to govern the Church. He shows that</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;most of the English Reformers were acquainted with Wycliffe&rsquo;s works:
            Cranmer declares that he set forth the truth of the Gospel; Hooper
            recalls how he resisted &lsquo;the popish doctrine of the Mass&rsquo;; Ridley,
            how he denied transubstantiation; and Bale, how he denounced
            the friars.... Bale records with triumph that, in spite of the
            efforts to suppress (the writings of Wicliffe), not one had utterly
            perished.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Dr. Rashdall goes the length of saying:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;It is certain that the Reformation had virtually broken out in
            the secret Bible-readings of the Cambridge Reformers before either
            the trumpet-call of Luther or the exigencies of Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>&rsquo;s
            personal and political position set men free once more to talk
            openly against the Pope and the monks, and to teach a simpler
            and more spiritual gospel than the system against which Wycliffe
            had striven.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if it be admitted that these statements are somewhat strong, they
      at least call attention to the fact of the vigorous Lollard leaven
      which permeated the English people, and are a very necessary corrective
      of the misleading assertions of Dr. James Gairdner on the matter.</p>
<p>Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> had other popular forces behind
      him&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg
      319]</a></span> rooted dislike to the clergy which characterised a
      large mass of the people, the effects of the teaching of the Christian
      Humanists of England, and the spread of Lutheran opinions throughout
      the land.</p>
<p>The Bishop of London, writing to Wolsey about the proposal to try his
      Chancellor, Dr. Horsey, for complicity in the supposed murder of Richard
      Hunne, declared that if the Chancellor</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;be tried by any twelve men in London, they be so maliciously set <i>in
                  favorem h&aelig;retic&aelig; pravitatis</i> that they will
                  cast and condemn any clerk though he were as innocent as
                  Abel.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This dislike was not confined to the capital. The Parliaments showed themselves
      anti-clerical long before Henry had thrown off his allegiance to Rome;<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> and
      Englishmen could find no better term of insult to throw at the Scots
      than to call them &ldquo;Pope&rsquo;s men.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>
<p>Nor should the work of the Christian Humanists be forgotten. The double
      tendency in their longings for a reformation of the abuses of superstition,
      of pilgrimages, of relic-worship, etc., may be seen in the lives of
      Sir Thomas More and of William Tyndale. When the former saw that reform
      meant the breaking up of the medi&aelig;val Church, he became more
      and more conservative. But More in 1520 (Feb. 28th) could write to
      Lea that if the Pope (Leo <span class="smcap">X.</span>) should withdraw
      his approval of Erasmus&rsquo; Greek New Testament, Luther&rsquo;s attacks on the
      Holy See were piety itself compared with such a deed.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> Tyndale,
      the favourite pupil of Dean Colet, on the other hand, went forward
      and earned the martyr&rsquo;s crown. These Christian Humanists had expected
      much from Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>, whom they looked
      on as imbued with the New Learning; and in the end perhaps they were
      not altogether mistaken. If the <i>Bishops&rsquo; Book</i> and the <i>King&rsquo;s
      Book</i> be studied, it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg
      320]</a></span> be seen that in both what is insisted upon is a reformation
      of conduct and a study of the Bible&mdash;quite in the spirit of Colet
      and of Erasmus.</p>
<p>The writings of Luther found early entrance into England, and were read
      by King<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> and
      people. A long list of them, including six copies of his work <i>De
      potestate Pap&aelig;</i>, is to be found in the stock of the Oxford
      bookseller, John Dorne<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> (1520).
      Erasmus, writing to Oecolampadius (May 15th, 1521), declares that there
      are many of Luther&rsquo;s books in England, and hints that but for his exertions
      they would have been burnt.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> That
      was before Luther&rsquo;s official condemnation. On May 28th, Silvester,
      Bishop of Worcester, wrote to Wolsey from Rome announcing that the
      Cardinals had agreed to declare Martin a heretic, and that a Bull was
      being prepared on the subject.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> The
      Bull itself appeared in Rome on the 15th of June; and thereafter our
      information about Luther&rsquo;s writings in England comes from evidence
      of endeavours to destroy them. Warham, the Archbishop of Canterbury,
      wrote to Wolsey (March 8th, 1521) that he had received letters from
      Oxford which declared that the University was infected with Lutheranism,
      and that the forbidden books were in circulation there.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> Indeed,
      most of the canons appointed to Wolsey&rsquo;s new foundation of the Cardinal
      College were suspect. Cambridge was as bad, if not worse. Members of
      the University met at the White Horse Tavern to read and discuss Luther&rsquo;s
      writings; the inn was called &ldquo;Germany,&rdquo; and those who frequented it &ldquo;the
      Germans.&rdquo; Pope Leo urged both the King and Wolsey to prevent the circulation
      of Lutheran literature; and they did their best to obey. We read that
      on May 12th, 1521, Wolsey went in great state to St. Paul&rsquo;s, and after
      various ceremonies mounted a scaffold, seated himself &ldquo;under a cloth
      of estate,&rdquo; and listened to a sermon preached by Bishop Fisher against
      Lutheran errors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg
      321]</a></span> At his feet on the right side sat the Pope&rsquo;s ambassadors
      and the Archbishop of Canterbury, and on the left side the imperial
      ambassadors and the Bishop of Durham. While the sermon was being preached,
      numbers of Lutheran books were burnt in a huge bonfire kindled hard
      by in St. Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> The
      representatives of Pope and Emperor saw it all, and doubtless reported
      to their respective Courts that Wolsey was doing his duty by Church
      and Empire. It may be doubted whether such theatrical exhibitions hindered
      the spread of Luther&rsquo;s books in England or prevented them being read.</p>
<p>All these things indicated a certain preparedness in England for the Reformation,
      and all meant that there was a strong national force behind Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> when
      he at last made up his mind to defy Rome.</p>
<p>Nor was a national separation from Rome so formidable an affair as Dr.
      Gairdner would have us believe. The Papacy had secularised itself,
      and European monarchs were accustomed to treat the Popes as secular
      princes. The possibility of England breaking away from papal authority
      and erecting itself into a separate patriarchate under the Archbishop
      of Canterbury had been thought probable before the divorce was talked
      about.<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>
<p>It was Henry himself who clung strenuously to the conception of papal
      supremacy, and who advocated it in a manner only done hitherto by canonists
      of the Roman Curia. Whatever be the secret reason which he gave to
      Sir Thomas More, and which silenced the latter&rsquo;s remonstrances, it
      is evident that the validity of Henry&rsquo;s marriage and the legitimacy
      of his children by Catharine of Aragon depended on the Pope being in
      possession of the very fullest powers of dispensation. Henry had been
      married to Catharine under very peculiar circumstances, which might
      well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span> suggest
      doubts about the validity of the marriage ceremony.</p>
<p>The England of Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span> was almost as much
      a satellite of Spain as Scotland was of France, and to make the alliance
      still stronger a marriage was arranged between Arthur, Prince of Wales,
      and Catharine the youngest of the three daughters of Ferdinand and
      Isabella of Spain. The Spanish Princess landed at Plymouth (October
      2nd, 1501), and the wedding took place in St. Paul&rsquo;s on November 14th.
      But Prince Arthur died a few months afterwards (April 2nd, 1502), and
      Catharine became a widow. The circumstances of the two nations appeared
      to require more than ever the cementing of the alliance by intermarriage,
      and it was proposed from the side of Spain that the young widow should
      marry Henry, her brother-in-law, now Prince of Wales.<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> Ferdinand
      brought pressure to bear on England by insisting that if this were
      not done Catharine should be sent back to Spain and the first instalment
      of her dowry (all that had been paid) returned. The two Kings then
      besieged the Pope, Julius <span class="smcap">II.</span>, to grant
      a dispensation for the marriage. At first His Holiness was very unwilling
      to consent. Such a marriage had been branded as sin by canonical law,
      and the Pope himself had great doubts whether it was competent for
      him to grant a dispensation in such a case.<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> In
      the end he was persuaded to give it. The two young people had their
      own scruples of conscience. Ferdinand felt called upon to reason with
      his proposed son-in-law.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> The
      confessor of his daughter was changed.<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> The
      Archbishop of Canterbury, who doubted whether the Pope could grant
      dispensation for what was a mortal sin in his eyes, was silenced.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> The
      wedding took place (June 11th, 1509).</p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></p>
<p>The marriage was in one sense singularly unfortunate. The first four children
      were either stillborn or died soon after birth; and it was rumoured
      in Rome as early as 1514 that Henry might ask to be divorced in order
      to save England from a disputed succession. Mary was born in 1516 and
      survived, but all the children who came afterwards were either stillborn
      or died in early infancy. It became evident by 1525 that if Henry did
      not divorce his wife he would have no male heir.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the lack of a male heir troubled Henry greatly.
      The English people had not been accustomed to a female sovereign; it
      was currently, if erroneously, reported in England that the laws of
      the land did not permit a woman to be sovereign, and such well-informed
      diplomatists as the Venetian Ambassadors believed the statement;<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>and
      the Tudor dynasty was not so firmly settled on the throne that it could
      afford to look forward to a disputed succession. The King&rsquo;s first idea
      was to ask the Pope to legitimise his illegitimate son the Duke of
      Richmond;<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a>and
      Cardinal Campeggio actually suggested that the Princess Mary should
      be married to her half-brother.<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> These
      projects came to an end with the death of the young Prince.</p>
<p>There seems to be no reason for questioning the sincerity of Henry&rsquo;s doubts
      about the legitimacy of his marriage with Catharine, or that he actually
      looked upon the repeated destruction of his hopes of a male heir as
      a divine punishment for the sin of that contract.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a>Questions
      of national policy and impulses of passion quicken marvellously conscientious
      convictions, but they do not show that the convictions are not real.
      In the perplexities of his position the shortest way out seemed to
      be to ask the Pope to declare that he had never been legally married
      to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span> Catharine.
      If he had scruples of conscience about his marriage with his brother&rsquo;s
      widow, this would end them; if the fears of a disputed succession haunted
      him, he could marry again, and might hope for a son and a lawful heir
      whose succession none would dispute. Cardinal Wolsey adopted his master&rsquo;s
      plans, and the Pope was to be asked for a declaration that the marriage
      with Catharine had been no marriage at all.</p>
<p>There entered, however, into all this, at what time it is not easy to
      determine, an element of sordidness which goes ill with asserted scruples
      of conscience and imperious necessities of State. Wolsey was astonished
      when he learned that Henry had made up his mind to marry Anne Boleyn,
      a lady whose station in life and personal reputation unfitted her for
      the position of Queen of England. It was Henry&rsquo;s inordinate, if not
      very long-lived, passion for this lady that put him in the wrong, and
      enabled the Pope to pose as the guardian of the public morality of
      Europe.</p>
<p>It is plain that Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> fully expected
      that the Pope would declare his first marriage invalid; there was many
      a precedent for such action&mdash;two in Henry&rsquo;s own family;<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> and
      the delay had nothing to do with the interests of public morality.
      The Pope was at the time practically in the power of Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span>,
      to whom his aunt, the injured Catharine, had appealed, and who had
      promised her his protection. One has only to study the phases of the
      protracted proceedings in the &ldquo;Divorce&rdquo; and compare them with the contemporary
      situation in Italy to see that all that the Curia cared for was the
      success of the papal diplomacy in the Italian peninsula. The interests
      of morality were so little in his mind that Clement proposed to Henry
      more than once that the King might take a second wife without going
      through the formality of having his first marriage declared null and
      void.<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> This
      had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg
      325]</a></span> the papal solution of the matter in an earlier instance,
      and Clement <span class="smcap">VII.</span> saw no reasons why what
      had been allowed to a King of Spain should be denied to the King of
      England.<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> He
      was prepared to tolerate bigamy, but not to thwart Charles, so long
      as the Emperor was master within Italy.<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a></p>
<p>It is needless to follow the intricacies of the Divorce. The protracted
      proceedings were an object lesson for English statesmen. They saw a
      grave moral question&mdash;whether a man could lawfully marry his deceased
      brother&rsquo;s widow; a matter vitally affecting the welfare of the English
      people&mdash;the possibility of a disputed succession; the personal
      wishes of a powerful, strong-willed, and choleric sovereign (for all
      considerations were present, not only the last)&mdash;all subjected
      to the shifting needs of a petty Italian prince. So far as England
      was concerned, the grave interest in the case ended when Campeggio
      adjourned the inquiry (July 23rd, 1529). Henry knew that he could not
      expect the Pope to give him what he wanted; and although his agents
      fought the case at Rome, he at once began preparing for the separation
      from papal jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The English nobles, who had long chafed under the rule of Wolsey, took
      advantage of the great Minister&rsquo;s failure in the Divorce negotiations
      to press forward his downfall. He was deprived of the Lord Chancellorship,
      which was given to Sir Thomas More, and was further indicted before
      the King&rsquo;s Bench for infringement of the law of <i>Pr&aelig;munire</i>&mdash;an
      accusation to which he pleaded guilty.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile Henry had taken measures to summon a Parliament; and in the
      interval between summons and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg
      326]</a></span> assembly, it had been suggested to him that Cranmer
      was of opinion that the best way to deal with the Divorce was to take
      it out of the hands of the Curia and consult the canonists of the various
      Universities of Europe. Cranmer was instructed to prepare the case
      to be laid before them. This was done so successfully that the two
      great English Universities, the French Universities of Paris, Orleans,
      Bourges, and Toulouse, decided that the King&rsquo;s marriage with Catharine
      was not valid; the Italian Universities of Ferrara, Padua, Pavia, and
      Bologna came to the same conclusion in spite of a proclamation issued
      by the Pope prohibiting all doctors from maintaining the invalid nature
      of the King&rsquo;s marriage.<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></p>
<p>Parliament met on November 3rd, 1529, and, from the matters brought before
      it, received the name of the
      &ldquo;Parliament for the enormities of the clergy.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> It
      revealed the force of lay opinion on which Henry might count in the
      struggle he was about to begin with the clergy. With a view of strengthening
      his hands still further, the King summoned an assembly of Notables,<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> which
      met on June 12th, 1530, and addressed the Pope in a letter in which
      they prayed him to consent to the King&rsquo;s desire, pointed out the evils
      which would follow from delaying the Divorce, and hinted that they
      might be compelled to take the matter into their own hands. This seems
      to have been the general feeling among the laity of England; for a
      foreigner writing to the Republic of Florence says: &ldquo;Nothing else is
      thought of in that island every day, except of arranging affairs in
      such a way that they do no longer be in want of the Pope, neither for
      filling vacancies in the Church, nor for any other purpose.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></p>
<p>Having made himself sure of the great mass of the laity, Henry next set
      himself to force the clergy into submission. He suddenly charged them
      all with being guilty of <i>Pr&aelig;munire</i> because they had accepted
      the authority of Papal Legates within the kingdom; and managed to extort
      a sum of &pound;100,000, to be paid in five yearly instalments, by
      way of a fine from the clergy of the Province of Canterbury.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> At
      the same meeting of Convocation (1531) the clergy were compelled, under
      threat of the law of <i>Pr&aelig;munire</i>, to declare that the King
      was &ldquo;their singular protector and only supreme lord, and, <i>as far
      as that is permitted by the law of Christ</i>, the Supreme Head of
      the Church and of the clergy.&rdquo; The ambiguity in the acknowledgment
      left a loophole for weak consciences; but the King was satisfied with
      the phrase, feeling confident that he could force his own interpretation
      of the acknowledgment on the Church. &ldquo;It is all the same,&rdquo; Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span>&rsquo;s
      ambassador wrote to his master, &ldquo;as far as the King is concerned, as
      if they had made no reservation; for no one now will be so bold as
      to contest with his lord the importance of this reservation.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a></p>
<p>This acknowledgment was, according to the King, simply a clearer statement
      of what was contained in the old statutes of <i>Pr&aelig;munire</i>,
      and in all his subsequent ecclesiastical legislation he claimed that
      he was only giving effect to the earlier laws of England.</p>
<p>The Parliament of 1532 gave the King important assistance in forcing on
      the submission, not only of the clergy of England, but of the Pope,
      to his wishes. The Commons presented a petition complaining of various
      grievances affecting the laity in the working of the ecclesiastical
      courts, which was sent with a set of demands from the King to the Convocation.
      The result was the important resolution of Convocation (May 15th, 1532)
      which is called the <i>Submission of the Clergy</i>, where it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg
      328]</a></span> promised not to make any new canons without the King&rsquo;s
      licence and ratification, and to submit all previous canons to a committee
      of revision, to consist of thirty-two persons, sixteen from Parliament
      and sixteen from the clergy, and all to be chosen by the King. This
      committee was to expunge all containing anything prejudicial to the
      King&rsquo;s prerogative. This Act of Convocation practically declared that
      the Church of England could neither make any rules for its own guidance
      without the King&rsquo;s permission, nor act according to the common law
      of the medi&aelig;val Church when that, in the King&rsquo;s opinion, invaded
      the royal prerogative.<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> From
      this Act the Church of England has never been able to free itself.
      The other deed of this Parliament which was destined to be of the greatest
      use to Henry in his dealings with the Pope was an Act dealing with
      the <i>annates</i>, <i>i.e.</i> one year&rsquo;s income from all ecclesiastical
      benefices paid to the Pope on entrance into any benefice. The Act declared
      that the <i>annates</i> should be withheld from the Pope and given
      to the King, but permitted His Majesty to suspend its operation so
      long as it pleased him.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> It
      was the suspensory clause which enabled Henry to coerce the Pope, and
      he was not slow to take advantage of it.<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> Writing
      to Rome (March 21st, 1532), he said:
      &ldquo;The Pope and Cardinals may gain our friendship by truth and justice.
      Take care that they do not hope or despair too much from this power
      which has been committed to us by the statute. I do not mean to deceive
      them, but to tell them the fact that this statute will be to their
      advantage, if they show themselves deserving of it; if not, otherwise.
      Nothing has been defined at present, which must be to their advantage
      if they do not despise my friendship.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></p>
<p>Archbishop Warham, who had presided at the Convocation which made the
      submission of the clergy, died in August 1532; and Henry resolved that
      Cranmer, notwithstanding his unwillingness, should succeed him as Archbishop
      of Canterbury. Cranmer conscientiously believed that the royal supremacy
      was a good thing, and would cure many of the ecclesiastical evils which
      no appeals to the Pope seemed able to reform; and he was also convinced
      that the marriage of Henry with Catharine had been one for which not
      even the highest ecclesiastical authority could give a dispensation.
      He was prepared to carry out the King&rsquo;s wishes in both respects. He
      could not be an acceptable Primate to the Roman Curia. Yet Henry, by
      threatening the Pope with the loss of the <i>annates</i>, actually
      compelled him to send Bulls to England, and that with unusual speed,
      ratifying the appointment to the Primacy of a man who was known to
      believe in the nullity of the King&rsquo;s marriage, and to be ready to give
      effect to his opinion; and this at a time when the Parliament of England
      had declared that the Primate&rsquo;s court was the supreme ecclesiastical
      tribunal for the English Church and people. The deed made the Curia
      really responsible for almost all that followed in England. For Parliament
      in February 1533, acting on the submission of the clergy, had passed
      an Act prohibiting all appeals to Rome from the Archbishop&rsquo;s court,
      and ordering that, if any appeals were taken, they must be to the King&rsquo;s
      Court of Chancery. This was the celebrated Act of Restraint of Appeals.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></p>
<p>In the beginning of 1533 (Jan. 25th), Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> was
      privately married to Anne Boleyn. He had taken the Pope&rsquo;s advice in
      this one particular, to get married without waiting for the Divorce;
      but soon afterwards (April 5th) he got from the Convocation of Canterbury
      a document declaring that the Pope had no power to grant a dispensation
      in such a case as the marriage of Henry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg
      330]</a></span> with Catharine;<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> and
      the Act of Restraint of Appeals had made such a decision practically
      final so far as England was concerned.</p>
<p>Cranmer was consecrated Archbishop of Canterbury on March 30th, 1533.
      His opinions were known. He had been one of the Cambridge &ldquo;Germans&rdquo;;
      he had freely consorted with Lutheran divines in Germany; he had begun
      to pray in private for the abolition of the Pope&rsquo;s power in England
      as early as 1525; and it was not without reason that Chapuys called
      him a &ldquo;Lutheran.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a></p>
<p>On April 11th, 1533, the new Primate asked the King to permit him to try
      the question of the Divorce before his own ecclesiastical court; and
      leave was granted him on the following day, as the principal minister &ldquo;of
      our spiritual jurisdiction.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> The
      trial was begun, and the court, acting on the decisions of Convocation
      two months earlier, which had declared<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> that
      no dispensation could be given for a marriage with the widow of a brother
      provided the marriage had been consummated, and<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> that
      the marriage between Arthur and Catharine had been consummated, pronounced
      that the marriage between the King and Catharine of Aragon was null
      and void.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> This
      was followed by an inquiry about the marriage between the King and
      Anne Boleyn, which was pronounced valid, and preparations were made
      for the coronation of Queen Anne, which took place on June 1st, 1533.<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p>
<p>This act of defiance to Rome was at once resented by the Pope. The Curia
      declared that the marriage between Henry and Catharine was lawful,
      and a Bull was issued commanding Henry to restore Catharine and put
      away Anne within ten days on pain of excommunication; which sentence
      the Emperor, all Christian Princes, and Henry&rsquo;s own subjects were called
      upon to execute by force of arms.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></p>
<p>The action at Rome was answered from England by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg
                  331]</a></span> the passing of several strong Acts of Parliament&mdash;all
                  in 1534. They completed the separation of the Church and
                  people of England from the See of Rome.</p>
<p>1. The Act forbidding the payment of <i>annates</i> to the Pope was again
      introduced, and this time made absolute; no <i>annates</i> were for
      the future to be sent to Rome as the first-fruits of any benefice.
      In the same Act new provisions were made for the appointment of Bishops;
      they were for the future to be elected by the Deans and Chapters on
      receiving a royal letter of leave and nomination.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a></p>
<p>2. An Act forbidding the payment of Peter&rsquo;s Pence to the Bishop of Rome;
      forbidding all application to the Pope for dispensations; and declaring
      that all such dispensations were to be sought for in the ecclesiastical
      courts within England.<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></p>
<p>3. The Act of Succession, which was followed by a second within the same
      year in which the nullity of the marriage of Henry with Catharine of
      Aragon was clearly stated, and Catharine was declared to be the &ldquo;Princess
      of Wales,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> the widow of Arthur; which affirms the validity
      of the King&rsquo;s marriage with Anne Boleyn, and declares that all the
      issue of that marriage are legitimate; and which affirms that, failing
      male succession, the crown falls to the Princess Elizabeth.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></p>
<p>4. The Supremacy Act, which declares that the King is rightfully the <i>Supreme
            Head of the Church of England</i>, has been recognised as such
            by Convocation, and that it is within his powers to make ecclesiastical
            visitations and to redress ecclesiastical abuses.<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a></p>
<p>5. The Treasons Act must also be included, inasmuch as one of its provisions
      is that it is treason to deny to the King any of his lawful titles
      (the Supreme Head of the Church of England being one), and that treason
      includes calling the King a heretic or a schismatic.<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a></p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></p>
<p>To complete the list, it is necessary to mention that the two Convocations
      of Canterbury and of York solemnly declared that &ldquo;the Roman Pontiff
      had no greater jurisdiction bestowed on him by God in the Holy Scriptures
      than any other foreign (<i>externus</i>) Bishop&rdquo;&mdash;a declaration
      called the <i>Abjuration of the Papal Supremacy by the Clergy</i>.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a></p>
<p>This separation of the Church of England from Rome really meant that instead
      of there being a dual control, there was to be a single one only. The
      Kings of England had always claimed to have some control over the Church
      of their realm; Henry went further, and insisted that he would share
      that supervision with no one. But it should be noticed that what he
      did claim was, to use the terms of canon law, the <i>potestas jurisdictionis</i>,
      not the <i>potestas ordinis</i>; he never asserted his right to ordain
      or to control the sacraments. Nor was there at first any change in
      definition of doctrines. The Church of England remained what it had
      been in every respect, with the exception that the Bishop of Rome was
      no longer recognised as the <i>Episcopus Universalis</i>, and that,
      if appeals were necessary from the highest ecclesiastical courts in
      England, they were not to be taken as formerly to Rome, but were to
      be settled in the King&rsquo;s courts within the land of England. The power
      of jurisdiction over the affairs of the Church could scarcely be exercised
      by the King personally. Appeals could be settled by his judges in the
      law courts, but he required a substitute to exercise his power of visitation.
      This duty was given to Thomas Cromwell, who was made Vicar-General,<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> and
      the office to some small extent may be said to resemble that of the
      Papal Legate; he represented the King as the Legate had represented
      the Pope.</p>
<p>It was impossible, however, for the Church of England to maintain exactly
      the place which it had occupied. There was some stirring of Reformation
      life in the land. Cranmer had been early attracted by the writings
      of Luther; Thomas Cromwell was not unsympathetic, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg
      333]</a></span> besides, he had the idea that there would be some advantage
      gained politically by an approach to the German Protestants. There
      was soon talk about a set of Articles which would express the doctrinal
      beliefs of the Church of England. It was, however, no easy matter to
      draft them. While Cranmer, Cromwell, and such new Bishops as Latimer,
      had decided leanings towards the theology of the Reformation, the older
      Bishops held strongly by the medi&aelig;val doctrines. The result was
      that, after prolonged consultations, little progress was made, and
      very varying doctrines seem to have been taught, all of which tended
      to dispeace. In the end, the King himself, to use his own words, &ldquo;was
      constrained to put his own pen to the book, and conceive certain articles
      which were agreed upon by Convocation as catholic and meet to be set
      forth by authority.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> They
      were published in 1536 under the title, <i>Articles devised by the
      Kyng&rsquo;s Highnes Majestie to stablysh Christen quietnes</i>, and were
      ordered to be read
      &ldquo;plainly&rdquo; in the churches.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> They
      came to be called the <i>Ten Articles</i>, the first doctrinal symbol
      of the Church of England.</p>
<p>According to the preface, they were meant to secure, by royal authority,
      unity and concord in religious beliefs, and to repress and utterly
      extinguish all dissent and discord. Foxe the Martyrologist describes
      them very accurately as meant for &ldquo;weaklings newly weaned from their
      mother&rsquo;s milk of Rome.&rdquo; Five deal with doctrines and five with ceremonies.
      The Bible, the Three Creeds (Apostles&rsquo;, Nicene, and Athanasian), and
      the doctrinal decisions of the first four &#338;cumenical Councils,
      are to be regarded as the standards of orthodoxy; baptism is necessary
      for salvation&mdash;children dying in infancy &ldquo;shall undoubtedly be
      saved thereby, and <i>else not</i>&rdquo;; the Sacrament of Penance is retained
      with confession and absolution, which are declared to be expedient
      and necessary; the substantial, real, corporeal Presence of Christ&rsquo;s
      Body and Blood under the form of Bread and Wine in the Eucharist is
      taught;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span> faith
      as well as charity is necessary to salvation; images are to remain
      in the churches; the saints and the Blessed Virgin are to be reverenced
      as intercessors; the saints are to be invoked; certain rites and ceremonies,
      such as clerical vestments, sprinkling with holy water, carrying candles
      on Candlemas Day, and sprinkling ashes on Ash-Wednesday, are good and
      laudable; the doctrines of Purgatory and of prayers for the dead were
      not denied, but people were warned about them. It should be noticed
      that while the three Sacraments of Baptism, the Eucharist, and Penance
      are retained, no mention is made of the other four, and that this is
      not unlike what Luther taught in the <i>Babylonian Captivity of the
      Church of Christ</i>; that while the Real Presence is maintained, nothing
      is said about Transubstantiation; that while images are retained in
      churches, all incensing, kneeling, or offering to images is forbidden;
      that while saints and the Virgin may be invoked as intercessors, it
      is said that it is a vain superstition to believe that any saint can
      be more merciful than Christ Himself; and that the whole doctrine of
      Attrition and Indulgences is paralysed by the statement that amendment
      of life is a necessary part of Penance.</p>
<p>It is only when these Articles are read along with the <i>Injunctions</i> issued
      in 1536 and 1538 that it can be fully seen how much they were meant
      to wean the people, if gradually, from the gross superstition which
      disgraced the popular medi&aelig;val religion. If this be done, they
      seem an attempt to fulfil the aspirations of Christian Humanists like
      Dean Colet and Erasmus.</p>
<p>After warning the clergy to observe all the laws made for the abolition
      of the papal supremacy, all those insisting on the supremacy of the
      King as the &ldquo;supreme Head of the Church of England,&rdquo; and to preach
      against the Pope&rsquo;s usurped power within the realm of England, the <i>Injunctions</i> proceed
      to say that the clergy are to expound the <i>Ten Articles</i> to their
      people. In doing so they are to explain why superfluous holy days ought
      not to be observed; they are to exhort their people against such superstitions
      as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span> images,
      relics, and priestly miracles. They are to tell them that it is best
      to keep God&rsquo;s commandments, to fulfil His works of charity, to provide
      for their families, and to bestow upon the poor the money they often
      lavish on pilgrimages, images, and relics. They are to see that parents
      and teachers instruct children from their earliest years in the Lord&rsquo;s
      Prayer, the Creed, and the Ten Commandments. They are to be careful
      that the sacraments are duly and reverently administered within their
      parishes, are to set an example of moral living, and are to give themselves
      to the study of the Scriptures. The second set of <i>Injunctions</i> (1538)
      goes further. The clergy are told to provide &ldquo;one whole Bible <i>of
      the largest volume</i> in English,&rdquo; which is to be set somewhere in
      the church where the parishioners can most easily read it; and they
      are to beware of discouraging any man from perusing it,
      &ldquo;for it is the lively word of God that every Christian man is bound
      to embrace and follow.&rdquo; They are to preach a sermon at least every
      quarter, in which they are to declare the very gospel of Christ, and
      to exhort the people to the works of charity, mercy, and faith especially
      prescribed in the Scriptures. They are to warn them against trusting
      to fancies entirely outside of Scripture, such as
      &ldquo;wandering to pilgrimages, offering of money or candles to images or
      relics, kissing or licking the same, and saying over a number of beads
      or suchlike superstitions.&rdquo; They are not to permit candles, tapers,
      or images of wax to be placed before the images in the churches, in
      order to avoid
      &ldquo;that most detestable offence of idolatry.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p>
<p>The <i>Ten Articles</i> thus authoritatively expounded are anything but &ldquo;essentially
      Romish with the Pope left out in the cold.&rdquo; They are rather an attempt
      to construct a brief creed which a pliant Lutheran and a pliant Romanist
      might agree upon&mdash;a singularly successful attempt, and one which
      does great credit to the theological attainments of the English King.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></p>
<p>It was thought good to have a brief manual of religious instruction to
      place in the hands of the lower clergy and of the people, perhaps because
      the <i>Ten Articles</i> were not always well received. A committee
      of divines, chiefly Bishops,<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> were
      appointed to &ldquo;compile certain rudiments of Christianity and a Catechism.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> The
      result was a small book, divided into four parts&mdash;an exposition
      of the Apostles&rsquo; Creed, of the <i>seven</i> Sacraments, of the Ten
      Commandments, of the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, and the Ave Maria. Two other parts
      were added from the <i>Ten Articles</i>&mdash;one on Justification,
      for which faith is said to be necessary; and the other on Purgatory,
      which is stoutly denied. Great difficulties were experienced in the
      compilation, owing to the &ldquo;great diversity of opinions&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> which
      prevailed among the compilers; and the book was a compromise between
      those who were stout for the old faith and those who were keen for
      the new; but in the end all seemed satisfied with their work. The chief
      difference between its teaching and that of the <i>Ten Articles</i> is
      that the name sacrament is given to seven and not three of the chief
      ceremonies of the medi&aelig;val Church; but, on the other hand, the
      doctrine of Purgatory is denied. It was expected that the King would
      revise the book before its publication,<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> but
      he &ldquo;had no time convenient to overlook the great pains&rdquo; bestowed upon
      it.<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> Drafts

      the book was finally issued in 1537 by the &ldquo;Archbishops and Bishops
      of England,&rdquo; and was therefore popularly called the <i>Bishops&rsquo; Book</i>.
      All the clergy were ordered &ldquo;to read aloud from the pulpit every Sunday
      a portion of this book&rdquo;
      to their people.<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> The

<p>Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> afterwards revised the <i>Bishops&rsquo;
            Book</i> according to his own ideas. The revision was published
            in 1543, and was known as the <i>King&rsquo;s Book</i>.<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a></p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest boon bestowed on the people of England by the <i>Ten
            Articles</i> and the <i>Injunctions</i> which enforced them was
            the permission to read and hear read a version of the Bible in
            their own tongue. For the vernacular Scriptures had been banned
            in England as they had not been on the Continent, save perhaps
            during the Albigensian persecution. The seventh of the <i>Constitutions
            of Thomas Arundel</i> ordains &ldquo;that no one hereafter translates
            into the English tongue or into any other, on his own authority,
            the text of Holy Scripture either by way of book, or booklet,
            or tract.&rdquo; This constitution was directed against Wiclif&rsquo;s translation,
            which had been severely proscribed. That version, like so many
            others during the Middle Ages, had been made from the Vulgate.
            But Luther&rsquo;s example had fired the heart of William Tyndale to
            give his countrymen an English version translated directly from
            the Hebrew and the Greek originals.</p>
<p>Tyndale was a distinguished scholar, trained first at Oxford and then
      at Cambridge. When at the former University he had belonged to that
      circle of learned and pious men who had encouraged Erasmus to complete
      his critical text of the New Testament. He knew, as did More, that
      Erasmus desired that the weakest woman should be able to read the Gospels
      and the Epistles of St. Paul; that the husbandman should sing portions
      of them to himself as he followed the plough; that the weaver should
      hum them to the tune of his shuttle; and that the traveller should
      beguile the tedium of the road by repeating their stories; and he did
      not, like More, turn his back on the ennobling enthusiasms of his youth.<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></p>
<p>Tyndale found that he could not attempt his task in England. He went to
      Germany and began work in Cologne; but, betrayed to the magistrates
      of that centre of German Romanism, he fled to Worms. There he finished
      the translation of the New Testament, and printed two editions, one
      in octavo and the other in quarto&mdash;the latter being enriched with
      copious marginal notes. The ecclesiastical authorities in England had
      early word of this translation, and by Nov. 3rd, Archbishop Warham
      was exerting himself to buy and destroy as many copies as he could
      get hold of both in England and abroad; and, thanks to his exertions,
      Tyndale was supplied with funds to revise his work and print a corrected
      edition. This version was welcomed in England, and passed secretly
      from hand to hand. It was severely censured by Sir Thomas More, not
      because the work was badly done, but really because it was so scholarly.
      The faithful translation of certain words and sentences was to the
      reactionary More &ldquo;a mischievous perversion of those writings intended
      to advance heretical opinion&rdquo;;<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> and,
      strange to say, Dr. James Gairdner seems to agree with him.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> Tyndale&rsquo;s
      version had been publicly condemned in England at the Council called
      by the King in 1530 (May), and copies of his book had been publicly
      burnt in St. Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard, while he himself had been tracked like
      a wild beast by emissaries of the English Government in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Cranmer induced Convocation in 1534 to petition for an English version
      of the Bible, and next year Cromwell persuaded Miles Coverdale to undertake
      his translation in 1535. It was made from the Vulgate with some assistance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg
      339]</a></span> from Luther&rsquo;s version, and was much inferior to the
      proscribed version of Tyndale; but it had a large private sale in England,
      and the King was induced to license it to enable the clergy to obey
      the <i>Injunctions</i> of 1536, which had ordered a copy of the English
      Bible to be placed in all the churches before August 1537.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></p>
<p>The Archbishop, however, had another version in view, which he sent to
      Cromwell (Aug. 1537), saying that he liked it better than any other
      translation, and hoped it would be licensed to be read freely until
      the Bishops could set forth a better, which he believes will not be
      until after Doomsday. This version was practically Tyndale&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Tyndale had entrusted one of his friends, Rogers, with his translation
      of the Old Testament, finished as far as the Book of Jonah, and with
      his complete version of the New Testament. Rogers had taken Tyndale&rsquo;s
      New Testament, his Old Testament as far as the Book of Chronicles,
      borrowed the remaining portion of the Old Testament from Coverdale&rsquo;s
      version, and printed them with a dedication to the King, signed Thomas
      Matthew.<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> This
      was the edition recommended by Cranmer to Cromwell, which was licensed.
      The result was that Tyndale&rsquo;s New Testament (the same version which
      had been denounced as pernicious, and which had been publicly burnt
      only a few years before) and a large part of his Old Testament were
      publicly introduced into the parish churches of England, and became
      the foundation of all succeeding translations of the Bible into the
      English language.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> On
      reconsideration, the translation was found to be rather too accurate
      for the Government, and some changes (certainly not corrections) were
      made in 1538&mdash;39. Thus altered, the translation was known as the <i>Great
      Bible</i>, and, because Cranmer wrote the preface, as Cranmer&rsquo;s Bible.<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg
      340]</a></span> was the version, the Bible &ldquo;of the largest volume,&rdquo; which
      was ordered to be placed in the churches for the people to read, and
      portions of which were to be read from the pulpit every Sunday, according
      to the <i>Injunctions</i> of 1538.</p>
<p>From 1533 on to the middle of 1539, there was a distinct if slow advance
      in England towards a real Reformation; then the progress was arrested,
      if the movement did not become decidedly retrograde. It seems more
      than probable that if Henry had lived a few years longer, there would
      have been another attempt at an advance.</p>
<p>Part of the advance had been a projected political and religious treaty
      with the German Protestants. Neither Henry viii. nor John Frederick
      of Saxony appears to have been much in earnest about an alliance, and
      from the English King&rsquo;s instructions to his envoys it would appear
      that his chief desire was to commit the German divines to an approval
      of the Divorce.<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> Luther
      was somewhat scornful, and seems to have penetrated Henry&rsquo;s design.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> The
      German theologians had no doubt but that the marriage of Henry with
      Catharine was one which should never have taken place; but they all
      held that, once made, it ought not to be broken.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> Determined
      efforts were made to capture the sympathies of Melanchthon. Bishop
      Foxe, selected as the theological ambassador, was instructed to take
      him presents to the value of &pound;70.<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> His
      books were placed on the course of study for Cambridge at Cromwell&rsquo;s
      order.<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> Henry
      exchanged complimentary letters, and graciously accepted the dedication
      of Melanchthon&rsquo;s <i>De Locis Communibus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> An
      embassy was despatched, consisting of Foxe, Bishop elect of Hereford;
      Heath, Archdeacon of Canterbury; and Dr. Barnes, an English divine,
      who was a pronounced Lutheran. They met the Protestant Princes at Schmalkald
      and had long discussions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg
      341]</a></span> The confederated Princes and Henry found themselves
      in agreement on many points: they would stoutly disown the primacy
      of the Pope; they would declare that they would not be bound by the
      decrees of any Council which the Pope and the Emperor might assemble;
      and they would pledge each other to get their Bishops and preachers
      to declare them null and void. The German Princes were quite willing
      to give Henry the title of &ldquo;Defender of the Schmalkald League.&rdquo; But
      they insisted as the first articles of any alliance that the English
      Church and King must accept the theology of the Augsburg Confession
      and adopt the ceremonies of the Lutheran Church; and on these rocks
      of doctrine and ritual the proposed alliance was shattered.<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> The
      Germans had their own private view of the English Reformation under
      Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>, which was neither very flattering
      nor quite accurate.</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;So far the King has become Lutheran, that, because the Pope has
            refused to sanction his divorce, he has ordered, on penalty of
            death, that every one shall believe and preach that not the Pope
            but himself is the head of the universal Church. All other papistry,
            monasteries, mass, indulgences, and intercessions for the dead,
            are pertinaciously adhered to.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The English embassy went from Schmalkald to Wittenberg, where they met
      a number of divines, including Luther and Melanchthon, and proceeded
      to discuss the question of doctrinal agreement. Melanchthon had gone
      over the Augsburg Confession, and produced a series of articles which
      presented all that the Wittenberg theologians could concede, and Luther
      had revised the draft.<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> Both
      the Germans were charmed with the learning and courtesy of Archdeacon
      Heath. Bishop Foxe &ldquo;had the manner of prelates,&rdquo; says Melanchthon,
      and his learning did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg
      342]</a></span> impress the Germans.<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> The
      conference came to nothing. Henry did not care to accept a creed ready
      made for him, and thought that ecclesiastical ceremonies might differ
      in different countries. He was a King &ldquo;reckoned somewhat learned, though
      unworthy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and having so many learned men in his realm, he
      could not accept at any creature&rsquo;s hand the observing of his and the
      realm&rsquo;s faith; but he was willing to confer with learned men sent from
      them.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a></p>
<p>Before the conference at Wittenberg had come to an end, Henry believed
      that he had no need for a German alliance. The ill-used Queen Catharine,
      who, alone of all persons concerned in the Divorce proceedings, comes
      out unstained, died on Jan. 7th, 1536. Her will contained the touching
      bequest: &ldquo;To my daughter, the collar of gold which I brought out of
      Spain&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a>&mdash;out
      of Spain, when she came a fair young bride to marry Prince Arthur of
      England thirty-five years before.</p>
<p>There is no need to believe that Henry exhibited the unseemly manifestations
      of joy which his enemies credit him with when the news of Catharine&rsquo;s
      death was brought to him, but it did free him from a great dread. He
      read men and circumstances shrewdly, and he knew enough of Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span> to
      believe that the Emperor, after his aunt&rsquo;s death, and when he had no
      flagrant attack on the family honour of his house to protest against,
      would not make himself the Pope&rsquo;s instrument against England.</p>
<p>Henry had always maintained himself and England by balancing France against
      the Empire, and could in addition weaken the Empire by strengthening
      the German Protestants. But in 1539, France and the Emperor had become
      allies, and Henry was feeling himself very insecure. It is probable
      that the negotiations which led to Henry&rsquo;s marriage with Anne of Cleves
      were due to this new danger. On the other hand, there had been discontent
      in England at many of the actions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg
      343]</a></span> which were supposed to come from the advance towards
      Reformation.</p>
<p>Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> had always spent money lavishly.
      His father&rsquo;s immense hoards had disappeared, while England, under Wolsey,
      was the paymaster of Europe, and the King was in great need of funds.
      In England as elsewhere the wealth of the monasteries seemed to have
      been collected for the purpose of supplying an empty royal exchequer.
      A visitation of monasteries was ordered, under the superintendence
      of Thomas Cromwell; and, in order to give him a perfectly free hand,
      all episcopal functions were for the time being suspended. The visitation
      disclosed many scandalous things. It was followed by the Act of Parliament
      (1536) for <i>The Dissolution of the Lesser Monasteries</i>.<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> The
      lands of all monasteries whose annual rental was less than &pound;200
      a year were given to the King, as well as all the ornaments, jewels,
      and other goods belonging to them. The dislodged monks and nuns were
      either to be taken into the larger houses or to receive some measure
      of support, and the heads were to get pensions sufficient to sustain
      them. The lands thus acquired might have been formed into a great crown
      estate yielding revenues large enough to permit taxation to be dispensed
      with; but the King was in need of ready money, and he had courtiers
      to gratify. The convent lands were for the most part sold cheaply to
      courtiers, and the numbers and power of the county families were largely
      increased. A new visitation of the remaining monasteries was begun
      in 1538, this time accompanied with an inquiry into superstitious practices
      indulged in in various parts of the country, and notorious relics were
      removed. They were of all sorts&mdash;part of St. Peter&rsquo;s hair and
      beard; stones with which St. Stephen was stoned; the hair shirt and
      bones of St. Thomas the martyr; a crystal containing a little quantity
      of Our Lady&rsquo;s milk, &ldquo;with two other bones&rdquo;; the &ldquo;principal relic in
      England, an angel with one wing that brought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg
      344]</a></span> Caversham (near Reading) the spear&rsquo;s head that pierced
      the side of our Saviour on the cross&rdquo;; the ear of Malchus, which St.
      Peter cut off; a foot of St. Philip at Winchester
      &ldquo;covered with gold plate and (precious) stones&rdquo;; and so forth.<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> Miraculous
      images were brought up to London and their mechanism exposed to the
      crowd, while an eloquent preacher thundered against the superstition:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;The bearded crucifix called the &lsquo;Rood of Grace&rsquo; (was brought from
            Maidstone, and) while the Bishop of Rochester preached it turned
            its head, rolled its eyes, foamed at the mouth, and shed tears,&mdash;in
            the presence, too, of many other famous saints of wood and stone
            ... the satellite saints of the Kentish image acted in the same
            way. It is expected that the Virgin of Walsingham, St. Thomas
            of Canterbury, and other images will soon perform miracles also
            in the same place; for the trickery was so thoroughly exposed
            that every one was indignant at the monks and impostors.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A second Act of Parliament followed, which vested all monastic property
      in the King; and this gave the King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg
      345]</a></span> possession not only of huge estates, but also of an
      immense quantity of jewels and precious metals.<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> The
      shrine of St. Thomas at Canterbury, when &ldquo;disgarnished,&rdquo; yielded, it
      is said, no fewer than twenty-six cartloads of gold and silver.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></p>
<p>This wholesale confiscation of monastic property, plundering of shrines,
      and above all the report that Henry had ordered the bones of St. Thomas
      of Canterbury to be burned and the ashes scattered to the winds, determined
      Pope Paul <span class="smcap">III.</span> to renew (Dec. 17th, 1538)
      the execution of his Bull of excommunication (Aug. 30th, 1535), which
      had been hitherto suspended. It was declared that the Bull might be
      published in St. Andrews or &ldquo;in oppido Calistrensi&rdquo; in Scotland, at
      Dieppe or Boulogne in France, or at Tuam in Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> The
      Pope knew that he could not get it published in England itself.</p>
<p>The violent destruction of shrines and pilgrimage places, which had been
      holiday resorts as well as places of devotion, could not fail to create
      some popular uneasiness, and there were other and probably deeper roots
      of discontent. England, like other nations, had been suffering from
      the economic changes which were a feature of the times. One form peculiar
      to England was that wool-growing had become more profitable than keeping
      stock or raising grain, and landed proprietors were enclosing commons
      for pasture land and letting much of their arable land lie fallow.
      The poor men could no longer graze their beasts on the commons, and
      the substitution of pasture for arable land threw great numbers out
      of employment. They had to sell the animals they could no longer feed,
      and did not see how a living could be earned; nor had they the compensation
      given to the disbanded monks. The pressure of taxation increased the
      prevailing distress.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg
      346]</a></span> Risings took place in Yorkshire, Lancashire, and Lincolnshire,
      and the insurgents marched singing:</p>

<p>In their demands they denounced equally the contempt shown for Holy Mother
      Church, the dissolution of the monasteries, the spoliation of shrines,
      the contempt shown to &ldquo;Our Ladye and all the saints,&rdquo; new taxes, the
      enclosure of commons, the doing away with use and wont in tenant rights,
      the branding of the Lady Mary as illegitimate, King&rsquo;s counsellors of &ldquo;low
      birth and small estimation,&rdquo; and the five reforming Bishops&mdash;Cranmer
      and Latimer being considered as specially objectionable.<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> The
      Yorkshire Rising was called the Pilgrimage of Grace.</p>
<p>The insurgents or &ldquo;pilgrims&rdquo; were not more consistent than other people,
      for they plundered priests to support their &ldquo;army&rdquo;;<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> and
      while they insisted on the primacy of the Bishop of Rome, they had
      no wish to see his authority re-established in England. They asked
      the King to admit the Pope to be head of spiritual things, giving spiritual
      authority to the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, &ldquo;so that the said
      Bishop of Rome have no further meddling.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a></p>
<p>The insurrections were put down, and Henry did not cease his spoliation
      of shrines and monasteries in consequence of their protests; but the
      feelings of the people made known by their proclamations, at the conferences
      held between their leaders and the representatives of authority, and
      by the examination of prisoners and suspected persons, must have suggested
      to his shrewd mind whether the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg
      347]</a></span> Reformation was not being pressed onward too hastily
      for the great majority of the English laity. England did not produce
      in the sixteenth century a great spiritual leader inspired by a prophetic
      conviction that he was speaking the truth of God, and able to create
      a like conviction in the hearts of his neighbours, while he was never
      so far before them that they could not easily follow him step by step.
      The King cried halt; and when Cromwell insisted on his plan of alliance
      with the Protestants of the Continent of Europe, he went the way of
      all the counsellors of Henry who withstood their imperious master (July
      28th, 1540).</p>
<p>But this is to anticipate. Negotiations were still in progress with the
      Lords of the Schmalkald League in the spring of 1539,<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> and
      the King was thinking of cementing his connection with the German Lutherans
      by marrying Anne of Cleves,<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> the
      sister-in-law of John Frederick of Saxony. The Parliament of 1539 (April
      28th to June 28th) saw the beginnings of the change. Six questions
      were introduced for discussion:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;Whether there be in the sacrament of the altar transubstantiation
            of the substance of bread and wine into the substance of flesh
            and blood or not? Whether priests may marry by the law of God
            or not? Whether the vow of chastity of men and women bindeth
            by the law of God or not? Whether auricular confession be necessary
            by the law of God or not? Whether private Masses may stand with
            the Word of God or not? Whether it be necessary by the Word of
            God that the sacrament of the altar should be administered under
            both kinds or not?&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The opinions of the Bishops were divided; but the lay members of the House
      of Lords evidently did not wish any change from the medi&aelig;val
      doctrines, and believed that no one could be such a wise theologian
      as their King when he confounded the Bishop with his stores of learning.
      &ldquo;We of the temporalitie,&rdquo; wrote one who was present,
      &ldquo;have been all of one opinion ... all England have cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg
      348]</a></span> to thank God and most heartily to rejoice of the King&rsquo;s
      most godly proceedings.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> So
      Parliament enacted the <i>Six Articles Act</i>,<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> a
      ferocious statute commonly called &ldquo;the bloody whip with six strings.&rdquo; To
      deny transubstantiation or to deprave the sacraments was to be reckoned
      heresy, and to be punished with burning and confiscation of goods.
      It was made a felony, and punishable with death, to teach that it was
      necessary to communicate in both kinds in the Holy Supper; or that
      priests, monks, or nuns vowed to celibacy might marry. All clerical
      marriages which had been contracted were to be dissolved, and clerical
      incontinence was punishable by loss of property and benefice. Special
      commissions were issued to hold quarterly sessions in every county
      for the enforcement of the statute. The official title of the Act was <i>An
      Act abolishing Diversity of Opinion</i>. The first commission issued
      was for the county of London, and at the first session five hundred
      persons were indicted within a fortnight. The law was, however, much
      more severe than its enforcement. The five hundred made their submission
      and received the King&rsquo;s pardon. It was under this barbarous statute
      that so-called heretics were tried and condemned during the last years
      of the reign of Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span></p>
<p>The revival of medi&aelig;val doctrine did not mean any difference in
      the strong anti-papal policy of the English King. It rather became
      more emphatic, and Henry spoke of the Pope in terms of the greatest
      disrespect. &ldquo;That most persistent idol, enemy of all truth, and usurpator
      of Princes, the Bishop of Rome,&rdquo; &ldquo;that cankered and venomous serpent,
      Paul, Bishop of Rome,&rdquo; are two of his phrases.<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a></p>
<p><i>The Act of the Six Statutes</i> made Lutherans, as previous Acts had
      made Papists, liable to capital punishment; but while Cromwell remained
      in power he evidently was able to hinder its practical execution. Cromwell,
      however, was soon to fall. He seemed to be higher in favour than ever.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg
      349]</a></span> He had almost forced his policy on his master, and
      the marriage of Henry with Anne of Cleves (Jan. 6th, 1540) seemed to
      be his triumph. Then Henry struck suddenly and remorselessly as usual.
      The Minister was impeached, and condemned without trial. He was executed
      (July 28th); and Anne of Cleves was got rid of on the plea of pre-contract
      to the son of the Duke of Lorraine (July 9th). It was not the fault
      of Gardiner, the sleuth-hound of the reaction, that Cranmer did not
      share the fate of the Minister. Immediately after the execution of
      Cromwell (July 30th), the King gave a brutal exhibition of his position.
      Three clergymen of Lutheran views, Barnes, Garret, and Jerome, were
      burnt at Smithfield; and three Romanists were beheaded and tortured
      for denying the King&rsquo;s spiritual supremacy.</p>
<p>Henry had kept himself ostentatiously free from responsibility for the
      manual of doctrine entitled <i>Institution of a Christian Man</i>.
      Perhaps he believed it too advanced for his people; it was at all events
      too advanced for the theology of the <i>Six Articles</i>; another manual
      was needed, and was published in 1543 (May 19th). It was entitled <i>A
      Necessary Doctrine and Erudition for any Christian Man; set forth by
      the King&rsquo;s Majesty of England</i>.</p>
<p>It was essentially a revision of the former manual, and may have been
      of composite authorship. Cranmer was believed to have written the chapter
      on faith, and it was revised by Convocation. The King, who issued it
      himself with a preface commending it, declared it to be &ldquo;a true and
      perfect doctrine for all people.&rdquo; It contains an exposition of the
      Creed, the Ten Commandments, the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, and of some selected
      passages of Scripture. Its chief difference from the former manual
      is that it teaches unmistakably the doctrines of <i>Transubstantiation</i>,
      the <i>Invocation of Saints</i>, and the <i>Celibacy of the Clergy</i>.
      It may be said that it very accurately represented the theology of
      the majority of Englishmen in the year 1543. For King and people were
      not very far apart. They both clung to medi&aelig;val theology; and
      they both detested the Papacy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg
      350]</a></span> and wished the clergy to be kept in due subordination.
      There was a widespread and silent movement towards an Evangelical Reformation
      always making itself apparent when least expected; but probably three-fourths
      of the people had not felt it during the reign of Henry. It needed
      Mary&rsquo;s burnings in Smithfield and the fears of a Spanish overlord,
      before the leaven could leaven the whole lump.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>THE REFORMATION UNDER EDWARD VI.<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></h3>
<p>When Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> died, in 1547 (Jan. 28th),
      the situation in England was difficult for those who came after him.
      A religious revolution had been half accomplished; a social revolution
      was in progress, creating popular ferment; evicted tenants and uncloistered
      monks formed raw material for revolt; the treasury was empty, the kingdom
      in debt, and the coinage debased. The kingly authority had undermined
      every other, and the King was a child. The new nobility, enriched by
      the spoils of the Church, did not command hereditary respect; and the
      Council which gathered round the King was torn by rival factions.<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a></p>
<p>Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> had died on a Friday, but his death
      was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span> kept
      concealed till the Monday (Jan. 31st), when Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span> was
      brought by his uncle, the Earl of Hertford, and presented to the Council.
      There a will of the late King was produced, the terms of which make
      it almost impossible to believe that Henry did not contemplate a further
      advance towards a Reformation. It appointed a Council of Regency, consisting
      of sixteen persons who were named. Eleven belonged to the old Council,
      and among them were five who were well known to desire an advance,
      while the two most determined reactionaries were omitted&mdash;Bishop
      Gardiner and Thirlby. The will also mentioned by name twelve men who
      might be added to the Council if their services were thought to be
      necessary. These were added. Then the Earl of Hertford was chosen to
      be Lord Protector of the Realm, and was promoted to be Duke of Somerset.
      The coronation followed (Feb. 20th), and all the Bishops were required
      to take out new commissions in the name of the young King&mdash;the
      King&rsquo;s ecclesiastical supremacy being thus rigidly enforced. Wriothesley,
      Henry&rsquo;s Lord Chancellor, who had been created the Earl of Southampton,
      was compelled to resign the Great Seal, and with his retirement the
      Government was entirely in the hands of men who wished the nation to
      go forward in the path of Reformation.</p>
<p>Signs of their intention were not lacking, nor evidence that such an advance
      would be welcomed by the population of the capital at least. On Feb.
      10th a clergyman and churchwardens had removed the images from the
      walls of their church, and painted instead texts of Scripture; an eloquent
      preacher, Dr. Barlow, denounced the presence of images in churches;
      images were pulled down from the churches in Portsmouth; and so on.
      In May it was announced that a royal visitation of the country would
      be made, and Bishops were inhibited from making their ordinary visitations.</p>
<p>In July (31st) the Council began the changes. They issued a series of <i>Injunctions</i><a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> to
      the clergy, in which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg
      353]</a></span> were commanded to preach against &ldquo;the Bishop of Rome&rsquo;s
      usurped power and jurisdiction&rdquo;; to see that all images which had been &ldquo;abused&rdquo; as
      objects of pilgrimages should be destroyed; to read the Gospels and
      Epistles in English during the service; and to see that the Litany
      was no longer recited or sung in processions, but said devoutly kneeling.
      They next issued <i>Twelve Homilies</i>, meant to guard the people
      against &ldquo;rash preaching.&rdquo; Such a series had been suggested as early
      as 1542, and a proposed draft had been presented to Convocation by
      Cranmer in that year, but had not been authorised. They were now issued
      on the authority of the Council. Three of them were composed by Cranmer.
      These sermons contain little that is doctrinal, and confine themselves
      to inciting to godly living.<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> Along
      with the <i>Homilies</i>, the Council authorised the issue of Udall&rsquo;s
      translation of the <i>Paraphrases</i> of Erasmus, which they meant
      to be read in the churches.</p>
<p>The royal visitation seems to have extended over a series of years, beginning
      in 1547. Dr. James Gairdner discovered, and has printed with comments,
      an account or report of a visitation held by Bishop Hooper in the diocese
      of Gloucester in 1551. One of the intentions of the visitation was
      to discover how far it was possible to expect preaching from the English
      clergy. Dr. Gairdner sums up the illiteracy exhibited in the report
      as follows:&mdash;Three hundred and eleven clergymen were examined,
      and of these one hundred and seventy-one were unable to repeat the <i>Ten
      Commandments</i>, though, strangely enough, all but thirty-four could
      tell the chapter (Ex. xx.) in which they were to be found; ten were
      unable to repeat the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer; twenty-seven could not tell who
      was its author: and thirty could not tell where it was to be found.
      The Report deserves study as a description of the condition of the
      clergy of the Church of England before the Reformation. These clergymen
      of the diocese of Gloucester were asked nine questions&mdash;three
      under three separate heads: (1)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg
      354]</a></span> How many commandments are there? Where are they to
      be found? Repeat them. (2) What are the Articles of the Christian Faith
      (the Apostles&rsquo; Creed)? Repeat them.&mdash;Prove them from Scripture.
      (3) Repeat the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer. How do you know that it is the Lord&rsquo;s?
      Where is it to be found? Only fifty out of the three hundred and eleven
      answered all these simple questions, and of the fifty, nineteen are
      noted as having answered <i>mediocriter</i>. Eight clergymen could
      not answer any single one of the questions; and while one knew that
      the number of the Commandments was ten, he knew nothing else. Two clergymen,
      when asked why the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer was so called, answered that it was
      because Christ had given it to His disciples when he told them to watch
      and pray; another said that he did not know why it was called the Lord&rsquo;s
      Prayer, but that he was quite willing to believe that it was the Lord&rsquo;s
      because the King had said so; and another answered that all he knew
      about it was that such was the common report. Two clergymen said that
      while they could not prove the articles of the Creed from Scripture,
      they accepted them on the authority of the King; and one said that
      he could not tell what was the Scripture authority for the Creed, unless
      it was the first chapter of Genesis, but that it did not matter, since
      the King had guaranteed it to be correct.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a></p>
<p>There is no reason to believe that the clergy of this diocese were worse
      than those in other parts of England. If this report be compared with
      the accounts of the unreformed clergy of central Germany given in the
      reports of the visitations held there between 1528 and 1535, the condition
      of things there which filled Luther with such despair, and induced
      him to write his Small Cathechism, was very much better than that of
      the clergy of England. Not more than three or perhaps four out of the
      three hundred and eleven had ever preached or could preach. These facts,
      extracted from the formal report of an authoritative visitation made
      by a Bishop, explain the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg
      355]</a></span> constant cry of the Puritans under Elizabeth for a
      preaching ministry.</p>
<p>The Council were evidently anxious that the whole service should be conducted
      in the English language, and that a sermon should always be part of
      the public worship. The reports of the visitation showed that it was
      useless to make any general order, but an example was given in the
      services conducted in the Royal Chapel. Meanwhile (1547) Thomas Hopkins
      was engaged in making a version of the Psalms in metre, to be sung
      both in private and in the churches, and these soon became highly popular.
      Like corresponding versions in France and in Germany, it served to
      spread the Reformation among the people; and, as might have been expected,
      Archbishop Laud did his best to stop the singing of these Psalms in
      later days.</p>
<p>The first Parliament of Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span> (Nov. 4th
      to Dec. 24th, 1547) made large changes in the laws of England affecting
      treason, which had the effect of sweeping away the edifice of absolute
      government which had been so carefully erected by Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> and
      his Minister Thomas Cromwell. The kingly supremacy in matters of religion
      was maintained; but the <i>Act of the Six Articles</i> was erased from
      the Statute Book, and with it all heresy Acts which had been enacted
      since the days of Richard <span class="smcap">II.</span>, and treason
      was defined as it had been in the days of Edward <span class="smcap">III.</span> This
      legislation gave an unwonted amount of freedom to the English people.</p>
<p>Convocation had met in November and December (1547), and, among other
      things, had agreed unanimously that in the Holy Supper the partakers
      should communicate in both <i>kinds</i>, and had passed a resolution
      by fifty-three votes to twelve that all canons against the marriage
      of the clergy should be declared void. These two resolutions were communicated
      to Parliament, with the result that an Act was passed ordaining that &ldquo;the
      most blessed Sacrament be hereafter commonly administered unto the
      people within the Church of England and Ireland, and other the King&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg
      356]</a></span> dominions, under both the kinds, that is to say, of
      bread and wine, except necessity otherwise require.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> An
      Act was also framed permitting the marriage of the clergy, which passed
      the Commons, but did not reach the House of Lords in time to be voted
      upon, and did not become law until the following year. Other two Acts
      bearing on the condition of the Church of England were issued by this
      Parliament. According to the one, Bishops were henceforth to be appointed
      directly by the King, and their courts were to meet in the King&rsquo;s name.
      According to the other, the property of all colleges, chantries, guilds,
      etc., with certain specified exceptions, was declared to be vested
      in the Crown.<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a></p>
<p>Communion in both kinds made necessary a new Communion Service, and as
      a tentative measure a new form for the celebration was issued by the
      Council, which is called by Strype the <i>Book of Communion</i>.<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> It
      enjoined that the essential words of the Mass should still be said
      in Latin, but inserted seven prayers in English in the ceremony. The
      Council also proceeded in their war against superstitions. They forbade
      the creeping to the Cross on Good Friday, the use of ashes on Ash-Wednesday,
      of palms on Palm Sunday, and of candles on Candlemas; and they ordered
      the removal of <i>all</i> images from the churches. Cranmer asserted
      that all these measures had been intended by Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span></p>
<p>The next important addition to the progress of the Reformation was the
      preparation and introduction of a Service Book<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a>&mdash;<i>The
      Boke of the Common Praier and Administration of the Sacramentes and
      other Rites and Ceremonies after the use of the Churche of England</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg
      357]</a></span> (1549), commonly called <i>The First Prayer-Book of
      King Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span></i> It was introduced by
      an <i>Act of Uniformity</i>,<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> which,
      after relating how there had been for long time in England &ldquo;divers
      forms of Common Prayer ... the use of Sarum, York, Bangor, and of Lincoln,&rdquo; and
      that diversity of use caused many inconveniences, ordains the universal
      use of this one form, and enacts penalties on those who make use of
      any other. The origin of the book is somewhat obscure. There is no
      trace of any commission appointed to frame it, nor of any formally
      selected body of revisers. Cranmer had the chief charge of it, and
      was assisted by a number of divines&mdash;though where they met is
      uncertain, whether at Windsor as the King records in his diary, or
      at Chertsey Abbey, as is said in the Grey Friars Chronicle. About the
      end of October the Bishops were asked to subscribe it, and it was subjected
      to some revision. It was then brought before the House of Lords and
      discussed there. It was in this debate that Cranmer disclosed that
      he had definitely abandoned the theory of transubstantiation. The Prayer-Book,
      however, was eminently conservative, and could be subscribed to by
      a believer in the old theory. The giving and receiving of the <i>Bread</i> is
      called the <i>Communion of the Body of Christ</i>, of the <i>Wine</i>,
      the <i>Communion of the Blood of Christ</i>; and the practice of making
      the sign of the Cross is adhered to at stated points in the ceremony.
      An examination of its structure and contents reveals that it was borrowed
      largely from the old English Use of Sarum, and from a new Service Book
      drafted by the Cardinal Quignon and dedicated to Pope Paul <span class="smcap">III.</span> The
      feeling that a new Service Book was needed was not confined to the
      Reformers, but was affecting all European Christians. The great innovation
      in this Liturgy was that all its parts were in the English language,
      and that every portion of the service could be followed and understood
      by all the worshippers.</p>
<p>With the publication of this <i>First Prayer-Book of King</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg
                  358]</a></span> <i>Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span></i> the
                  first stage of the Reformation during his reign comes to
                  an end. The changes made had all been contemplated by Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> himself,
                  if we are to believe what Cranmer affirmed. They did not
                  content the more advanced Reformers, and they were not
                  deemed sufficient by Cranmer himself.</p>
<p>The changes made in the laws of England&mdash;the repeal of the &ldquo;bloody&rdquo; <i>Statue
            of the Six Articles</i> and of the treason laws&mdash;had induced
            many of the English refugees who had gone to Germany and to Switzerland
            to return to their native land. The Emperor Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span> had
            defeated the German Protestants in the battle of M&uuml;hlberg
            in 1547 (April), and England for a few years became a place of
            refuge for continental Protestants fleeing from the requirements
            and penalties of the <i>Interim</i>. All this gave a strong impetus
            to the Reformation movement in England. Martin Bucer, compelled
            to leave Strassburg, found refuge and taught in Cambridge, where
            he was for a time the regius professor of divinity. Paul B&uuml;chlein
            (usually known by his latinised name of Fagius), a compatriot
            of Bucer and a well-known Hebrew scholar, was also settled at
            Cambridge, where he died (Nov. 1549). Peter Martyr Vermigli and
            Bernardino Ochino, two illustrious Italian Protestants, came
            to England at the invitation of Cranmer himself, and long afterwards
            Queen Elizabeth confessed that she had been drawn towards their
            theology. Peter Alexander of Arles and John &agrave; Lasco, the
            Pole, also received the protection and hospitality of England.<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> The
            reception of these foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg
            359]</a></span> divines, and their appointment as teachers in
            the English universities, did not escape protest from the local
            teachers of theology, who were overruled by the Government.</p>
<p>Between the first and the second stage of the Reformation of the Church
      of England in this reign, a political change occurred which must be
      mentioned but need not be dwelt upon. The Duke of Somerset incurred
      the wrath of his colleagues, and of the new nobility who had profited
      by the sale of Church lands, by his active sympathy with the landless
      peasantry, and by his proposals to benefit them. He was driven from
      power, and his place was taken by the unscrupulous Earl of Warwick,
      who became Lord Protector, and received the Dukedom of Northumberland.
      The new Governor of England has been almost universally praised by
      the advanced Reformers because of the way in which he pushed forward
      the Reformation. It is well to remember in these days, when the noble
      character of the Duke of Somerset has received a tardy recognition,<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> that
      John Knox, no mean judge of men, never joined in the praise of Northumberland,
      and greatly preferred his predecessor, although his advance in the
      path of Reformation had been slower and much more cautious.</p>
<p>There was much in the times to encourage Northumberland and his Council
      to think that they might hurry on the Reformation movement.</p>
<p>The New Learning had made great strides in England, and was leavening
      all the more cultured classes, and it naturally led to the discredit
      of the old theology. The English advanced Reformers who had taken refuge
      abroad, and who now returned,&mdash;men like Ridley and Hooper,&mdash;could
      not fail to have had some influence on their countrymen; they had almost
      all become imbued with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg
      360]</a></span> Zwinglian type of theology, and Bullinger was their
      trusted adviser. It seemed as if the feelings of the populace were
      changing, for the mobs, instead of resenting the destruction of images,
      were rather inspired by too much iconoclastic zeal, and tried to destroy
      stained-glass windows and to harry priests. Cranmer&rsquo;s influence, always
      on the side of reform, had much more weight with the Council than was
      the case under Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> He had abandoned
      long ago his belief in transubstantiation, he had given up the Lutheran
      doctrine of consubstantiation, if he ever held it, and had now accepted
      a theory of a real but spiritual Presence in the communion elements
      which did not greatly differ from the more moderate Zwinglian view.
      The clergy, many of them, were making changes which went far beyond
      the Act of Uniformity. The removal of restrictions on printing the
      Bible had resulted in the publication of more than twenty editions,
      most of them with annotations which explained and enforced the new
      theology on the authority of Scripture.</p>
<p>In these circumstances the Council enforced the Act of Uniformity in a
      one-sided way&mdash;against the Romanist sympathisers. Many Romanist
      Bishops were deprived of their sees, and their places were filled by
      such men as Coverdale, Ridley, Ponet, and Scovey&mdash;all advanced
      Reformers. John Knox himself, freed from his slavery in the French
      galleys by the intervention of the English Government and made one
      of the King&rsquo;s preachers, was offered the bishopric of Rochester, which
      he declined. It must be remembered, however, that the Lord Protector
      and his <i>entourage</i> seem to have been quite as much animated by
      a desire to fill their own pockets as by zeal to promote the cause
      of the Reformation. Indeed, there came to be in England at this time
      something like the <i>tulchan</i> Bishops of a later period in Scotland;
      great nobles got possession of the episcopal revenues and allowed the
      new Bishops a stipend out of them.<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a></p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></p>
<p>Then came a second revision of the Prayer-Book&mdash;<i>The Boke of Common
            Prayer and Administration of the Sacramentes and other Rites
            and Ceremonies in the Churche of England</i> (1552). It is commonly
            called the <i>Second Prayer-Book of King Edward the Sixth</i>.<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> Cranmer
            had conferences with some of the Bishops as early as Jan. 1551
            on the subject, and also with some of the foreign divines then
            resident in England; and it is more than probable that his intention
            was to frame such a liturgy as would bring the worship of the
            Church of England into harmony with that of the continental Reformers.
            There is no proof that the book was ever presented to Convocation
            for revision, or that it was subject to a debate in Parliament,
            as was its predecessor. The authoritative proclamation says:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;The King&rsquo;s most excellent majesty, with the assent of the Lords
            and Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by the
            authority of the same, has caused the aforesaid order of common
            service, entitled The Book of Common Prayer, to be faithfully
            and godly perused, explained, and made fully perfect, and by
            the aforesaid authority has annexed and joined it, so explained
            and perfected, to this present statute.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This <i>Book of Common Prayer</i> deserves special notice, because, although
      some important changes were made, it is largely reproduced in the Book
      of Common Prayer which is at present used in the Church of England.
      The main differences between it and the <i>First Prayer-Book of King
      Edward</i> appear for the most part in the communion service, and were
      evidently introduced to do away with all thought of a propitiatory
      Mass. The word <i>altar</i> is expunged, and <i>table</i> is used instead: <i>minister</i> and <i>priest</i> are
      used indifferently as equivalent terms. &ldquo;The minister at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg
      362]</a></span> the time of the communion, and at all other times in
      his ministration, shall use neither Alb, Vestment, nor Cope; but being
      an archbishop or bishop, he shall have or wear a rochet: and being
      a priest or deacon, he shall have and wear a surplice only.&rdquo; Instead
      of &ldquo;standing humbly afore the midst of the altar,&rdquo; he was to stand &ldquo;at
      the north side of the table&rdquo;; and the communion table was ordered to
      be removed from the east end of the church and to be placed in the
      chancel. Ordinary instead of unleavened bread was ordered to be used.
      In the older book the prayer, <i>Have mercy on us, O Lord</i>, had
      been used as an invocation of God present in the sacramental elements;
      in the new it became an ordinary prayer to keep the commandments. The <i>Ten
      Commandments</i> were introduced for the first time. Some rubrics&mdash;that
      enjoining the minister to add a little water to the wine&mdash;were
      omitted. Similar changes were made in the services for baptism and
      confirmation, and in the directions for ordination. One rubric was
      retained which the more advanced Reformers wished done away with. Communicants
      were required to receive the elements kneeling. But the difficulties
      were removed by a later rubric:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;Yet lest the same kneeling might be thought or taken otherwise,
            we do declare that it is not meant thereby, that any adoration
            is done, or ought to be done, either unto the sacramental bread
            or wine there bodily received, or to any real or essential presence
            there being of Christ&rsquo;s natural flesh and blood.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This addition is said, on somewhat uncertain evidence, to have been suggested
      by John Knox.</p>
<p>The most important change, however, was that made in the words to be addressed
      to the communicant in the act of partaking. In the <i>First Prayer-Book</i> the
      words were:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;When the priest delivereth the sacrament of the Body of Christ,
            he shall say to every one these words:</p>
      <p class="blockquot"><i>&lsquo;The Body of our Lord Jesus Christ, which was
                  given, for thee, preserve thy body and soul unto everlasting
                  life.&rsquo;</i></p>
      <p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></p>
      <p>And the minister delivering the sacrament of the Blood, and giving
            every one once to drink and no more, shall say:</p>
      <p class="blockquot"><i>&lsquo;The Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, which
                  was shed for thee, preserve thy body and soul unto everlasting
                  life.&rsquo;</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the <i>Second Prayer-Book</i> the rubric was altered to:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;Then the minister, when he delivereth the bread, shall say:</p>
      <p class="blockquot"><i>&lsquo;Take and eat this in remembrance that Christ
                  died for thee, and feed on Him in thy heart by faith and
                  with thanksgiving.&rsquo;</i></p>
      <p>And the minister that delivereth the cup shall say:</p>
      <p class="blockquot"><i>&lsquo;Drink this in remembrance that Christ&rsquo;s blood
                  was shed for thee, and be thankful.&rsquo;</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The difference represented by the change in these words is between what <i>might</i> be
      the doctrine of transubstantiation and a sacramental theory distinctly
      lower than that of Luther or Calvin, and which <i>might</i> be pure
      Zwinglianism.</p>
<p>This <i>Second Prayer-Book of King Edward</i> was enforced by a second <i>Act
            of Uniformity</i>, which for the first time contained penalties
            against laymen as well as clergymen&mdash;against
      &ldquo;a great number of people in divers parts of the realm, who did wilfully
      refuse to come to their parish churches.&rdquo; The penalties themselves
      show that many of the population refused to be dragged along the path
      of reformation as fast as the Council wished them to go.<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a></p>
<p>Soon after there followed a new creed or statement of the fundamental
      doctrines received by the Church of England. This was the <i>Forty-two
      Articles</i>, interesting because they formed the basis of the later
      Elizabethan <i>Thirty-nine Articles</i>. They were thrust on the Church
      of England in a rather disreputable way. It was expressly slated on
      the title-page that they had been agreed upon by the Bishops and godly
      divines at the last Convocation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg
      364]</a></span> in London&mdash;a statement which is not correct. They
      were never presented to Convocation, and were issued on the authority
      of the King alone, and received his signature on June 12th (1553),
      scarcely a month before he died.</p>
<p>One other document belonging to the reign of Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span> must
      be mentioned&mdash;the <i>Reformatio Legum Ecclesiasticarum</i>, drafted
      by Cranmer. The Archbishop had begun in 1544 to collect passages from
      the old Canon Law which he thought might serve to regulate the government
      and discipline of the Church of England. A commission of thirty-two
      was appointed to assist him, and from these a committee of eight were
      selected to &ldquo;rough hew the Canon Law.&rdquo; When the selection was made,
      a Bill to legalise it was introduced into Parliament, but it failed
      to pass; and the <i>Reformatio Legum</i> never became authoritative
      in England. It was as well, for the book enacted death penalties for
      various heresies, which would have made it a cruel weapon in the hands
      of a persecuting government.</p>
<p>During the reign of Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span> the beginnings
      of that Puritanism which was so prominent in the time of Elizabeth
      first manifested themselves. Its two principal spokesmen were the Bishops
      Hooper and Ridley. Hooper was an ardent follower of Zwingli, and was
      esteemed to be the leader of the party; and Ridley&rsquo;s sentiments were
      not greatly different. Hooper came into contact with the Government
      when he was appointed to the See of Gloucester. He then objected to
      the oath required from Bishops at their consecration, and to the episcopal
      robes, which he called &ldquo;Aaronic&rdquo; vestments. The details of the contest
      are described by a Zwinglian sympathiser, Macronius, in a letter to
      Bullinger at Zurich<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> (Aug.
      28th, 1550):</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;The King, as you know, has appointed him (Hooper) to the bishopric
            of Gloucester, which, however, he refused to accept unless he
            cd. be altogether relieved from all <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg
            365]</a></span>appearance of popish superstition. Here then a
            question immediately arises as to the form of oath which the
            Bishops have ordered to be taken in the name of God, the saints,
            and the Gospels; which impious oath Hooper positively refused
            to take. So, when he appeared before the King in the presence
            of the Council, Hooper convinced the King by many arguments that
            the oath should be taken in the name of God alone, who knoweth
            the heart. This took place on the 20th of July. It was so agreeable
            to the godly King, that with his own pen he erased the clause
            of the oath which sanctioned swearing by any creatures. Nothing
            could be more godly than this act, or more worthy of a Christian
            king. When this was done there remained the form of episcopal
            consecration, wh., as lately prescribed by the Bishops in Parliament,
            differs but little from the popish one. Hooper therefore obtained
            a letter from the King to the Archbishop of Canterbury (Cranmer),
            that he might be consecrated without superstition. But he gained
            nothing by this, as he was referred from the Archbishop of Canterbury
            to the Bishop of London (Ridley), who refused to use any other
            form of consecration than that which had been subscribed by Parliament.
            Thus the Bishops mutually endeavour that none of their glory
            shall depart. A few days after, on the 30th of July, Hooper obtained
            leave from the King and the Council to be consecrated by the
            Bishop of London without any superstition. He replied that he
            would shortly send an answer either to the Council or to Hooper.
            While, therefore, Hooper was expecting the Bishop&rsquo;s answer, the
            latter went to court and alienated the minds of the Council from
            Hooper, making light of the use of the vestments and the like
            in the church, and calling them mere matters of indifference.
            Many were so convinced by him that they would hardly listen to
            Hooper&rsquo;s defence when he came into court shortly afterwards.
            He therefore requested them, that if they would not hear him
            speak, they would at least think it proper to hear and read his
            written apology. His request was granted: wherefore he delivered
            to the King&rsquo;s councillors, in writing, his opinion respecting
            the discontinuance of the use of vestments and the like puerilities.
            And if the Bishop cannot satisfy the King with other reasons,
            Hooper will gain the victory. We are daily expecting the termination
            of this controversy, which is only conducted between individuals,
            either by conference or by letter, for fear of any tumult being
            excited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg
            366]</a></span> among the ignorant. You see in what a state of
            affairs the Church would be if they were left to the Bishops,
            even to the best of them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the end, Hooper allowed himself to be persuaded, and was consecrated
      in the usual way.</p>
<p>The advanced Reformers in England were probably incited to demand more
      freedom than the law permitted by the sight of the liberty enjoyed
      by men who were not Englishmen. French and German Protestants had come
      to England for refuge, and had been welcomed. The King had permitted
      them to use the Augustines&rsquo; church in London, that they might &ldquo;have
      the pure ministry of the Word and Sacraments according to the apostolic
      form,&rdquo; and they enjoyed their privileges.</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;We are altogether exempted by letters patent from the King and
            Council from the jurisdiction of the Bishops. To each church
            (I mean the German and the French) are assigned two ministers
            of the Word (among whom is my unworthy self), over whom has been
            appointed superintendent the most illustrious John &agrave; Lasco;
            by whose aid alone, under God, we foreigners have arrived at
            our present state of pure religion. Some of the Bishops, and
            especially the Bishop of London, with certain others, are opposed
            to our design; but I hope their opposition will be ineffectual.
            The Archbishop of Canterbury, the special patron of foreigners,
            has been the chief support and promoter of our church, to the
            great astonishment of some.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These foreigners, outside episcopal control and not subject to the <i>Acts
            of Uniformity</i>, enjoyed liberties of worship which were not
            granted to Englishmen. They were driven out of the country when
            Mary succeeded; but under Elizabeth and James they had the same
            privileges and were naturally envied by the English Puritans,
            coerced by Bishops and harried by Acts of Uniformity.</p>
<p>While the Reformation was being pushed forward in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg
                  367]</a></span> England at a speed too great for the majority
                  of the people, the King was showing the feebleness of his
                  constitution. He died on the 6th of July 1553, and the
                  collapse of the Reformation after his death showed the
                  uncertainty of the foundation on which it had been built.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3>THE REACTION UNDER MARY.<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></h3>
<p>One of the last acts of the dying King had been to make a will regulating
      the succession. It was doubtless suggested to him by the Duke of Northumberland,
      but, once adopted, the lad clung to it with Tudor tenacity. It set
      aside as illegitimate both his sisters. It also set aside the young
      Queen of Scotland, who, failing Mary and Elizabeth, was the legitimate
      heir, being the granddaughter of Margaret, the eldest sister of Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>,
      and selected the Lady Jane Grey, the representative (eldest child of
      eldest child) of Mary, the younger sister of Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> Both
      the King and his Council seem to have thought that the nation would
      not submit to a Roman Catholic on the throne; and Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span> appears
      to have agreed with them. He considered the chances of Mary&rsquo;s succession
      small.</p>
<p>The people of England, however, rallied to Mary, as the nearest in blood
      to their old monarch, who, notwithstanding his autocratic rule, had
      never lost touch with his people.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></p>
<p>The new Queen naturally turned to her cousin Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span> for
      guidance. He had upheld her mother&rsquo;s cause and her own; and in the
      dark days which were past, his Ambassador Chapuys had been her indefatigable
      friend.</p>
<p>It was Mary&rsquo;s consuming desire to bring back the English Church and nation
      to obedience to Rome&mdash;to undo the work of her father, and especially
      of her brother. The Emperor recommended caution; he advised the Queen
      to be patient; to watch and accommodate her policy to the manifestations
      of the feelings of her people; to punish the leaders who had striven
      to keep her from the throne, but to treat all their followers with
      clemency. Above all, she was to mark carefully the attitude of her
      sister Elizabeth, and to reorganise the finances of the country.</p>
<p>Mary had released Gardiner from the Tower, and made him her trusted Minister.
      His advice in all matters, save that of her marriage, coincided with
      the Emperor&rsquo;s. It was thought that small difficulty would be found
      in restoring the Roman Catholic religion, but that difficulties might
      arise about the papal supremacy, and especially about the reception
      of a papal Legate. Much depended on the Pope. If His Holiness did not
      demand the restoration of the ecclesiastical property alienated during
      the last two reigns, and now distributed among over forty thousand
      proprietors, all might go well.</p>
<p>Signs were not wanting, however, that if the people were almost unanimous
      in accepting Mary as their Queen, they were not united upon religion.
      When Dr. Gilbert Bourne, preaching at St. Paul&rsquo;s Cross (Aug. 13th,
      1553) praised Bishop Bonner, he was interrupted by shouts; a dagger
      was thrown at him; he was hustled out of the pulpit, and his life was
      threatened. The tumult was only appeased when Bradford, a known Protestant,
      appealed to the crowd. The Lord Mayor of London was authorised to declare
      to the people that it was not the Queen&rsquo;s intention to constrain men&rsquo;s
      consciences, and that she meant to trust solely to persuasion to bring
      them to the true faith.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></p>
<p>Five days later (August 18th), Mary issued her first <i>Proclamation about
            Religion</i>, in which she advised her subjects &ldquo;to live together
            in quiet sort and Christian charity, leaving those new-found
            devilish terms of papist or heretic and such like.&rdquo; She declared
            that she meant to support that religion which she had always
            professed; but she promised &ldquo;that she would not compel any of
            her subjects thereunto, <i>unto such time as further order, by
            common assent, may be taken therein</i>&rdquo;&mdash;a somewhat significant
            threat. The proclamation prohibited unlicensed preaching and
            printing &ldquo;any book, matter, ballad, rhyme, interlude, process,
            or treatise, or to play any interlude, except they have Her Grace&rsquo;s
            special licence in writing for the same,&rdquo; which makes it plain
            that from the outset Mary did not intend that any Protestant
            literature should be read by her subjects if she could help it.<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a></p>
<p>Mary was crowned with great ceremony on October 1st, and her first Parliament
      met four days later (Oct. 5th to Dec. 6th, 1553). It reversed a decision
      of a former Parliament, and declared that Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>&rsquo;s
      marriage with Catharine of Aragon had been valid, and that Mary was
      the legitimate heir to the throne; and it wiped out all the religious
      legislation under Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span> The Council
      had wished the anti-papal laws of Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> to
      be rescinded; but Parliament, especially the House of Commons, was
      not prepared for anything so sweeping. The Church of England was legally
      restored to what it had been at the death of Henry, and Mary was left
      in the anomalous position of being the supreme head of the Church in
      England while she herself devoutly believed in the supremacy of the
      Bishop of Rome. The title and the powers it gave were useful to restore
      by royal proclamation the medi&aelig;val ritual and worship, and Mass
      was reintroduced in this way in December.<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile the marriage of the Queen was being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg
                  371]</a></span> discussed. Mary herself decided the matter
                  by solemnly promising the Spanish Ambassador (Oct. 19th)
                  that she would wed Philip of Spain; the marriage treaty
                  was signed on January 12th, 1554; the formal betrothal
                  took place in March, and the wedding was celebrated on
                  July 25th.<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> It
                  was very unpopular from the first. The boys of London pelted
                  with snowballs the servants of the Spanish embassy sent
                  to ratify the wedding treaty (Jan. 1st, 1554); the envoys
                  themselves were very coldly received by the populace; and
                  Mary had to issue a proclamation commanding that all courtesy
                  should be used to the Prince of Spain and his train coming
                  to England to marry the Queen.<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a></p>
<p>In September (1553) the pronouncedly Protestant Bishops who had remained
      in England to face the storm, Cranmer, Ridley, Coverdale, Latimer,
      were ejected and imprisoned; the Protestant refugees from France and
      Germany and many of the eminent Protestant leaders had sought safety
      on the Continent; the deprived Romanist Bishops, Gardiner, Heath, Bonner,
      Day, had been reinstated; and the venerable Bishop Tunstall, who had
      acted as Wolsey&rsquo;s agent at the famous Diet of Worms, had been placed
      in the See of Durham.</p>
<p>Various risings, one or two of minor importance and a more formidable
      one under Sir Thomas Wyatt, had been crushed. Lady Jane Grey, Lord
      Guilford Dudley (February 12th, 1554), Sir Thomas Wyatt, Lord Suffolk,
      and others were executed. Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span> strongly
      recommended the execution of the Princess Elizabeth, but his advice
      was not followed.</p>
<p>England was still an excommunicated land, and both Queen and King Consort
      were anxious to receive the papal peace. As soon as he had been informed
      by Mary of her succession to the throne, the Pope, Julius <span class="smcap">II.</span>,
      had selected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg
      372]</a></span> Cardinal Pole to be his Legate to England (early in
      August 1553). No one could have been more suitable. He was related
      to the royal house of England, a grandson of the Duke of Clarence,
      who was the brother of Edward <span class="smcap">IV.</span> He had
      so thoroughly disapproved of the anti-papal policy of Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> that
      he had been compelled to live in exile. He was a Cardinal, and had
      almost become Pope. No one could have been more acceptable to Mary.
      He had protested against her mother&rsquo;s divorce, and had suffered for
      it; and he was as anxious as she to see England restored to the papal
      obedience. But many difficulties had to be cleared away before Pole
      could land in England as the Pope&rsquo;s Legate. The English people did
      not love Legates, and their susceptibilities had to be soothed. If
      the Pope made the restoration of the Church lands a condition of the
      restoration of England to the papal obedience, and if Mary insisted
      on securing that obedience, there would be a rebellion, and she would
      lose her crown. No one knew all these difficulties better than the
      Emperor, and he exerted himself to overcome them. The Curia was persuaded
      that, as it was within the Canon Law to alienate ecclesiastical property
      for the redemption of prisoners, the Church might give up her claims
      to the English abbey lands in order to win back the whole kingdom.
      Pole himself had doubts about this. He believed that he might be allowed
      to reason with the lay appropriators and persuade them to make restoration,
      and his enthusiasm on the subject caused many misgivings in the minds
      of both Charles and Philip. Nor could the Cardinal land in England
      until his attainder as an English nobleman had been reversed by Parliament.
      He had been appointed Legate to England once before (February 7th,
      1536), in order to compass Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>&rsquo;s
      return to the papal obedience; he had written against the Royal Supremacy.
      Neither Lords nor Commons were very anxious to receive him.</p>
<p>At last, more than thirteen months after his appointment, the way was
      open for his coming to England. He landed at Dover (Nov. 20th, 1554),
      went on to Gravesend,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg
      373]</a></span> and there found waiting him an Act of Parliament revers
      ing his attainder. It had been introduced into the Lords, passed in
      the Upper House in two days, was read three times in the Commons in
      one day, and received the Royal Assent immediately thereafter (Nov.
      27th, 1554). Tunstall, the Bishop of Durham, brought him letters patent,
      empowering him to exercise his office of Legate in England. He embarked
      in a royal barge with his silver cross in the prow, sailed up the Thames
      on a favouring tide, landed at Whitehall, and was welcomed by Mary
      and Philip. On the following day the two Houses of Parliament were
      invited to the Palace to meet him, and he explained his commission.
      The day after, the question was put in both Houses of Parliament whether
      the nation should return to the papal obedience, and was answered affirmatively.
      Whereupon Lords and Commons joined in a supplication to the Queen &ldquo;that
      they might receive absolution, and be received into the body of the
      Holy Catholic Church, under the Pope, the Supreme Head thereof.&rdquo; The
      Supplication was presented on the 30th, and in its terms the Queen
      besought the Legate to absolve the realm for its disobedience and schism.
      Then, while the whole assembly knelt, King and Queen on their knees
      with the others, the Legate pronounced the absolution, and received
      the kingdom
      &ldquo;again into the unity of our Mother the Holy Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It now remained to Parliament to pass the laws which the change required.
      In one comprehensive statute all the anti-papal legislation of the
      reigns of Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> and of Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span> was
      rescinded, and England was, so far as laws could make it,<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> what
      it had been in the reign of Henry <span class="smcap">VII.</span> Two
      days later (Dec. 2nd, 1554), on the first Sunday in Advent, Philip
      and Mary, with the Legate, attended divine service in St. Paul&rsquo;s, and
      after Mass listened to an eloquent sermon from Bishop Gardiner, in
      the course of which he publicly abjured the teaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg
      374]</a></span> of his book <i>De vera obedientia</i>.<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> Convocation
      received a special absolution from the Legate. To show how thoroughly
      England had reconciled itself to Mother Church, Parliament proceeded
      to revive the old Acts against heresy which had been originally passed
      for the suppression of Lollardy, among them the notorious <i>De h&aelig;retico
      comburendo</i>, and England had again the privilege of burning Evangelical
      Christians secured to it by Act of Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a></p>
<p>In March 1554 the Queen had issued a series of <i>Injunctions</i> to all
      Bishops, instructing them on a variety of matters, all tending to bring
      the Church into the condition in which it had been before the innovations
      of the late reign. The Bishops were to put into execution all canons
      and ecclesiastical laws which were not expressly contrary to the statutes
      of the realm. They were not to inscribe on any of their ecclesiastical
      documents the phrase <i>regia auctoritate fulcitus</i>; they were to
      see that no heretic was admitted to any ecclesiastical office; they
      were to remove all married priests, and to insist that every person
      vowed to celibacy was to be separated from his wife if he had married;
      they were to observe all the holy days and ceremonies which were in
      use in the later days of the reign of King Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>;
      all schoolmasters suspected of heresy were to be removed from their
      office. These <i>Injunctions</i> kept carefully within the lines of
      the Act which had rescinded the ecclesiastical legislation of the reign
      of Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span><a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> The
      Bishop of London, Bonner, had previously issued a list of searching
      questions to be put to the clergy of his diocese, which concerned the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg
      375]</a></span> laity as well as the clergy, and which went a good
      deal further. He asked whether there were any married clergymen, or
      clergymen who had not separated themselves from their wives or concubines?
      Whether any of the clergy maintained doctrines contrary to the Catholic
      faith? Whether any of the clergy had been irregularly or schismatically
      ordained? Whether any of them had said Mass or administered the sacraments
      in the English language after the Queen&rsquo;s proclamation? Whether they
      kept all the holy days and fasting days prescribed by the Church? Whether
      any of the clergy went about in other than full clerical dress? Whether
      any persons in the parish spoke in favour of clerical marriage? These
      and many other minute questions were put, with the evident intention
      of restoring the medi&aelig;val ceremonies and customs in every detail.<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> His
      clergy assured the Bishop that it was impossible to make all the changes
      he demanded at once, and Bonner was obliged to give them till the month
      of November to get their parishes in order. This London visitation
      evidently provoked a great deal of discontent. In April (1554) &ldquo;a dead
      cat was hung on the gallows in the Cheap, habited in garments like
      those of a priest. It had a shaven crown, and held in its forepaws
      a round piece of paper to represent a wafer.... A reward of twenty
      marks was offered for the discovery of the author of the outrage, but
      it was quite ineffectual.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> Other
      graver incidents showed the smouldering discontent.</p>
<p>The revival in Parliament of the old anti-heresy laws may be taken as
      the time clearly foreshadowed in the Queen&rsquo;s first proclamation on
      religious affairs when persuasion was to cease and force take its place.
      The platitudes of many modern historians about Mary&rsquo;s humane and merciful
      disposition, about Gardiner&rsquo;s aversion to shedding blood, about &ldquo;the
      good Bishop&rdquo; Bonner&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg
      376]</a></span> benevolent attempt to persuade his victims to recant,
      may be dismissed from our minds. The fact remains, that the persecutions
      which began in 1555 were clearly indicated in 1553, and went on with
      increasing severity until the Queen&rsquo;s death put an end to them.</p>
<p>The visitations had done their work, and the most eminent of the Reformed
      bishops and divines had been caught and secured in various prisons. &ldquo;The
      Tower, the Fleet, the Marshalsea, the King&rsquo;s Bench, Newgate, and the
      two Counters were full of them.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> Their
      treatment differed. &ldquo;The prisoners in the King&rsquo;s Bench had tolerably
      fair usage, and favour sometimes shown them. There was a pleasant garden
      belonging thereunto, where they had liberty sometimes to walk.&rdquo; They
      had also the liberty of meeting for worship, as had the prisoners in
      the Marshalsea. Their sympathisers who had escaped the search kept
      them supplied with food, as did the early Christians their suffering
      brethren in the first centuries. But in some of the other prisons the
      confessors were not only confined in loathsome cells, but suffered
      terribly from lack of food. At the end of Strype&rsquo;s catalogue of the
      two hundred and eighty-eight persons who were burnt during the reign
      of Mary, he significantly adds, &ldquo;besides those that dyed of famyne
      in sondry prisons.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> Some
      of the imprisoned were able to draw up (May 8th, 1554) and send out
      for circulation a confession of their faith, meant to show that they
      were suffering simply for holding and proclaiming what they believed
      to be scriptural truth. They declared that they believed all the canonical
      books of Scripture to be God&rsquo;s very Word, and that it was to be the
      judge in all controversies of faith; that the Catholic Church was the
      Church which believed and followed the doctrines taught in Scripture;
      that they accepted the Apostles&rsquo; Creed and the decisions of the first
      four &#338;cumenical Councils and of the Council of Toledo, as well
      as the teachings of Athanasius, Iren&aelig;us,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg
      377]</a></span> Tertullian, and Damasus; that they believed that justification
      came through the mercy of God, and that it was received by none but
      by faith only, and that faith was not an opinion, but a persuasion
      wrought by the Holy Ghost; they declared that the external service
      of God ought to be according to God&rsquo;s Word, and conducted in a language
      which the people could understand; they confessed that God only by
      Jesus Christ is to be prayed to, and therefore disapproved of the invocation
      of the saints; they disowned Purgatory and Masses for the dead; they
      held that Baptism and the Lord&rsquo;s Supper were the Sacraments instituted
      by Christ, were to be administered according to the institution of
      Christ, and disallowed the mutilation of the sacrament, the theory
      of transubstantiation, and the adoration of the bread.<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> This
      was signed by Ferrar, Hooper, Coverdale (Bishops), by Rogers (the first
      martyr), by Bradford, Philpot, Crome, Saunders, and others. John Bradford,
      the single-minded, gentle scholar, was probably the author of the Confession.</p>
<p>Cardinal Pole, in his capacity as papal Legate, issued a commission (Jan.
      28th, 1555) to Bishop Gardiner and several others to try the prisoners
      detained for heresy. Then followed (Feb. 4th, 1555) the burning of
      John Rogers, to whom Tyndale had entrusted his translation of the Scriptures,
      and who was the real compiler of the Bible known as Matthews&rsquo;. The
      scenes at his execution might have warned the authorities that persecution
      was not going to be persuasive. Crowds cheered him as he passed to
      his death, &ldquo;as if he were going to his wedding,&rdquo;
      the French Ambassador reported. His fate excited a strong feeling of
      sympathy among almost all classes in society, which was ominous. Even
      Simon Renard, the trusted envoy of Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span>,
      took the liberty of warning Philip that less extreme measures ought
      to be used. But the worst of a persecuting policy is that when it has
      once begun it is almost impossible to give it up without confession
      of defeat. Bishop Hooper was sent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg
      378]</a></span> Gloucester to suffer in his cathedral town, Saunders
      to Coventry, and Dr. Taylor was burnt on Aldham Common in Suffolk.
      Several other martyrs suffered the same fate of burning a few days
      afterwards.</p>
<p>Robert Ferrar, the Reformed Bishop of St. David&rsquo;s, was sent to Carmarthen
      to be burnt in the chief town of his diocese (March 30th, 1555). Perhaps
      it was his death that gave rise to the verses in Welsh, exhorting the
      men of the Principality to rise in defence of their religion against
      the English who were bent on its destruction, and calling them to extirpate
      image worship and the use of the crucifix.<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a></p>
<p>Bishops Ridley and Latimer and Archbishop Cranmer had been kept in confinement
      at Oxford since April 1554; and they were now to be proceeded against.
      The two Bishops were brought before the Court acting on a commission
      from Cardinal Pole, the Legate. They were condemned on Oct. 1st, 1555,
      and on the 16th they were burnt at Oxford in the present Broad Street
      before Balliol College. Cranmer witnessed their death from the top
      of the tower in which he was confined.</p>
<p>In the Archbishop&rsquo;s case it was deemed necessary, in order to fulfil the
      requirements of Canon Law, that he should be tried by the Pope himself.
      He was accordingly informed that his sovereigns had &ldquo;denounced&rdquo; him
      to the Pope, and that His Holiness had commissioned the Cardinal Du
      Puy, Prefect of the Inquisition, to act on his behalf, and that Du
      Puy had delegated the duty to James Brooks, who had succeeded Hooper
      as Bishop of Gloucester, to the Dean of St. Paul&rsquo;s, and to the Archdeacon
      of Canterbury. The trial took place in St. Mary&rsquo;s Church. The accusers,
      Philip and Mary, were represented by Drs. Martyn and Story. They, in
      the name of their sovereigns, presented a lengthy indictment, in which
      the chief charges were adultery, perjury, and heresy. The first meant
      that although a priest he had been married, and had even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg
      379]</a></span> married a second time after he had been made an Archbishop;
      the second, that he had sworn obedience to the Pope and broken his
      oath; and the third, that he had denied the doctrine of transubstantiation.<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a></p>
<p>Cranmer refused to acknowledge the jurisdiction of his judges, but answered
      the charges brought against him to his accusers because they represented
      his sovereigns. He denied that the Pope had any ecclesiastical power
      within England; but submitted to the kingly supremacy. As Brooks had
      no authority from the Pope to do more than hear the case, no judgment
      was pronounced; it was only intimated that the proceedings would be
      reported to Rome. Cranmer was conducted back to his prison. There he
      addressed first one, then a second letter to the Queen.<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> In
      dignified and perfectly respectful language he expressed the degradation
      of the kingdom exhibited in the act of the sovereigns appealing to
      an &ldquo;outward judge, or to an authority coming from any person out of
      this realm&rdquo; to judge between them and one of their own subjects. Cranmer
      early in his career had come to the unalterable opinion that the papal
      supremacy was responsible for the abuses and disorders in the medi&aelig;val
      Church, and that reformation was impossible so long as it was maintained.
      In common with every thoughtful man of his generation, he repudiated
      the whole structure of papal claims built up by the Roman Curia during
      the fifteenth century, and held that it was in every way incompatible
      with the loyalty which every subject owed to his sovereign and to the
      laws of his country. He took his stand on this conviction.</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;Ignorance, I know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;may excuse other men; but he that
            knoweth how prejudicial and injurious the power and authority
            which the Pope challengeth everywhere is to the Crown, laws,
            and customs of this realm, and yet will allow the same, I cannot
            see in anywise how he can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg
            380]</a></span> keep his due allegiance, fidelity, and truth
            to the Crown and slate of this realm.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his second letter he struck a bolder note, and declared that the oath
      which Mary had sworn to maintain the laws, liberties, and customs of
      the realm was inconsistent with the other oath she had taken to obey
      the Pope, to defend his person, and to maintain his authority, honour,
      laws, and privileges. The accusation of perjury did not touch him at
      all. The sovereigns&mdash;Bishop Brooks, appointed to try him&mdash;every
      constituted authority in the realm&mdash;when confronted by it, had
      to choose between the oath of allegiance to country or to Papacy; he
      had chosen allegiance to his fatherland; others who acted differently
      betrayed it. That was his position. The words he addressed to Queen
      Mary&mdash;&ldquo;I fear me that there be contradictions in your oath&rdquo;&mdash;was
      his justification.</p>
<p>At Rome, Cranmer was found guilty of contumacy, and the command went forth
      that he was to be deposed, degraded, and punished as a heretic. In
      the meantime he was burnt in effigy at Rome. When he heard his sentence,
      he composed an Appeal to a General Council, following, he said, the
      example of Luther.<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> The
      degradation was committed to Bonner and Thirlby, and was executed by
      the former with his usual brutality. This done, he was handed over
      to the secular authorities for execution. Then began a carefully prepared
      course of refined mental torture, which resulted in the &ldquo;Recantations
      of Thomas Cranmer.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> A
      series of recantations was presented to him, which he was ordered to
      sign by his sovereign; and, strange as it may seem now, it was the
      sovereign&rsquo;s command that made it almost impossible for Cranmer to refuse
      to sign the papers which, one after another, were given him. He was
      a man who felt the necessity of an ultimate authority. He had deliberately
      put aside that of the Pope, and as deliberately placed that of the
      sovereign in its place; and now the ultimate authority, which his conscience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg
      381]</a></span> approved, commanded him to sign. The first four were
      not real recantations; Cranmer could sign them with a good conscience;
      they consisted of generalities, the effect of which depended on the
      meaning of the terms used, and everyone knew the meanings which he
      had attached to the words all throughout his public life. But the fifth
      and the sixth soiled his conscience and occasioned his remorse. It
      was not enough for Mary, Pole, and Bonner that they were able to destroy
      by fire the bodies of English Reformers, they hoped by working partly
      on the conscience and partly on the weakness of the leader of the English
      Reformation, to show the worthlessness of the whole movement. In the
      end, the aged martyr redeemed his momentary weakness by a last act
      of heroism. He knew that his recantations had been published, and that
      any further declaration made would probably be suppressed by his unscrupulous
      antagonists. He resolved by a single action to defeat their calculations
      and stamp his sincerity on the memories of his countrymen. His dying
      speech was silenced, as he might well have expected; but he had made
      up his mind to something which could not be stifled.<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a></p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;At the moment he was taken to the stake he drew from his bosom
            the identical paper (the recantation), throwing it, in the presence
            of the multitude, with his own hands into the flames, asking
            pardon of God and of the people for having consented to such
            an act, which he excused by saying that he did it for the public
            benefit, as, had his life, which he sought to save, been spared
            him, he might at some time have still been of use to them, praying
            them all to persist in the doctrines believed by him, and absolutely
            denying the Sacrament and the supremacy of the Church. And, finally,
            stretching forth his arm and right hand, he said: &lsquo;This which
            hath sinned, having signed the writing, must be the first to
            suffer punishment&rsquo;; and thus did he place it in the fire and
            burned it himself.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></p>
<p>If the martyrdoms of Ridley and Latimer lighted the torch, Cranmer&rsquo;s spread
      the conflagration which in the end burnt up the Romanist reaction and
      made England a Protestant nation. The very weakness of the aged Primate
      became a background to make the clearer his final heroism. The &ldquo;common
      man&rdquo; sympathised with him all the more. He had never been a very strong
      man in the usual sense of the words. The qualities which go to form
      the exquisite liturgist demand an amount of religious sensibility and
      sympathy which seldom belongs to the leader of a minority with the
      present against it and the future before it. His peculiar kind of courage,
      which enabled him to face Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> in
      his most truculent moods, was liker a woman&rsquo;s than a man&rsquo;s, and was
      especially called forth by sympathy with others in suffering. None
      of Henry&rsquo;s Ministers pleaded harder or more persistently for the Princess
      Mary, the woman who burnt him, than did Cranmer; and he alone of all
      his fellows dared to beseech the monarch for Cromwell in his fall.<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a></p>
<p>The death of Cranmer was followed by a long succession of martyrdoms.
      Cardinal Pole became the Archbishop of Canterbury, and in Philip&rsquo;s
      absence the principal adviser of the Queen. He did not manage, if he
      tried, to stop the burnings. Sometimes he rescued prisoners from the
      vindictive Bonner; at others he seems to have hounded on the persecutors.
      Mary&rsquo;s conscience, never satisfied at the confiscation of property,
      compelled her to restore the lands still in possession of the Crown,
      and to give up the &ldquo;first fruits&rdquo; of English benefices&mdash;the only
      result being to awaken the fears of thousands of proprietors, and set
      them against the papal claims. She attempted to restore the monastic
      institutions, with but scanty results; to revive pilgrimages to shrines,
      which were very forced affairs, and had to be kept alive by fining
      the parents of children who did not join them. The elevation of Pope
      Paul <span class="smcap">IV.</span> (Cardinal Caraffa) to the See of
      Rome increased her difficulties. The new Pontiff, a Neapolitan, hated
      her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span> Spanish
      husband, and personally disliked Cardinal Pole, her chief adviser.
      Her last years were full of troubles.</p>
<p>Mary died in 1558 (Nov. 17th). &ldquo;The unhappiest of queens, and wives, and
      women,&rdquo; she had been born amidst the rejoicings of a nation, her mother
      a princess of the haughtiest house in Europe. In her girlhood she had
      been the bride-elect of the Emperor&mdash;a lovely, winning young creature,
      all men say. In her seventeenth year, at the age when girls are most
      sensitive, the crushing stroke which blasted her whole life fell upon
      her. Her father, the Parliament, and the Church of her country called
      her illegitimate; and thus branded, she was sent into solitude to brood
      over her disgrace. When almost all England hailed her Queen in her
      thirty-seventh year, she was already an old woman, with sallow face,
      harsh voice, her dark bright eyes alone telling how beautiful she had
      once been. But the nation seemed to love her who had been so long yearning
      for affection; she married the man of her choice; and she felt herself
      the instrument selected by Heaven to restore an excommunicated nation
      to the peace of God. Her husband, whom she idolised, tired of living
      with her after a few years. The child she passionately longed for and
      pathetically believed to be coming never came.<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> The
      Church and the Pope she had sacrificed so much for, disregarded her
      entreaties, and seemed careless of her troubles. The people who had
      welcomed her, and whom she really loved, called her &ldquo;Bloody&rdquo; Mary,&mdash;a
      name which was, after all, so well deserved that it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg
      384]</a></span> always remain. Each disappointment she took as a warning
      from Heaven that atonement had not yet been paid for England&rsquo;s crimes,
      and the fires of persecution were kept burning to appease the God of
      sixteenth century Romanism.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h3>THE SETTLEMENT UNDER ELIZABETH.<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a></h3>
<p>Mary Tudor&rsquo;s health had long been frail, and when it was known for certain
      that she would leave no direct heir (i.e. from about June 1558), the
      people of England were silently coming to the conclusion that Elizabeth
      must be Queen, or civil war would result. It seemed also to be assumed
      that she would be a Protestant, and that her chief adviser would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg
      386]</a></span> be William Cecil, who had been trained in statecraft
      as secretary to England&rsquo;s greatest statesman, the Lord Protector Somerset.
      So it fell out.</p>
<p>Many things contributed to create such expectations. The young intellectual
      life of England was slowly becoming Protestant. Both the Spanish ambassadors
      noticed this with alarm, and reported it to their master.<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> This
      was especially the case among the young ladies of the upper classes,
      who were becoming students learned in Latin, Greek, and Italian, and
      at the same time devout Protestants, with a distinct leaning to what
      afterwards became Puritanism. Elizabeth herself, at her most impressionable
      age had been the pupil of Bishop Hooper, who was accustomed to praise
      her intelligence. &ldquo;In religious matters she has been saturated ever
      since she was born in a bitter hatred to our faith,&rdquo; said the Bishop
      of Aquila.<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> The
      common people had been showing their hatred of Romanism, and
      &ldquo;images and religious persons were treated disrespectfully.&rdquo;
      It was observed that Elizabeth &ldquo;was very much wedded to the people
      and thinks as they do,&rdquo; and that
      &ldquo;her attitude was much more gracious to the common people than to others.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> The
      burnings of the Protestant martyrs, and especially the execution of
      Cranmer, had stirred the indignation of the populace of London and
      the south counties against Romanism, and the feelings were spreading
      throughout the country. All classes of the people hated the entire
      subjugation of English interests to those of Spain during the late
      reign, just as the people of Scotland at the same time were growing
      weary of French domination under Mary of Lorraine, and Elizabeth shared
      the feeling of her people.<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a></p>
<p>Yet there was so much in the political condition of the times to make
      both Elizabeth and Cecil pause before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg
      387]</a></span> committing themselves to the Reformation, that it is
      necessary to believe that religious conviction had a great influence
      in determining their action. England was not the powerful nation in
      1558-60 which it became after twenty years under the rule of the great
      Queen. The agrarian troubles which had disturbed the three reigns of
      Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>, Edward, and Mary had not died
      out. The coinage was still as debased as it had been in the closing
      years of Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> Trade was stagnant,
      and the country was suffering from a two years&rsquo; visitation of the plague.
      The war with France, into which England had been dragged by Spain,
      had not merely drained the country of men and money, but was bringing
      nothing save loss of territory and damage to prestige. Nor was there
      much to be hoped from foreign aid. The Romanist reaction was in full
      swing throughout Europe, and the fortunes of the continental Protestants
      were at their lowest ebb. It was part of the treaty of Cateau-Cambr&eacute;sis
      (April 1559) that France and Spain should unite to crush the Protestantism
      of the whole of Europe, and the secret treaty between Philip <span class="smcap">II.</span> and
      Catherine de&rsquo; Medici in 1565<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> showed
      that such a design was thought possible of accomplishment during the
      earlier years of Elizabeth. It was never wholly abandoned until the
      defeat of the Armada in 1588. Cecil&rsquo;s maxim, that the Reformation could
      not be crushed until England had been conquered, had for its corollary
      that the conquest of England must be the prime object of the Romanist
      sovereigns who were bent on bringing Europe back to the obedience of
      Rome. The determination to take the Protestant side added to the insecurity
      of Elizabeth&rsquo;s position in the earlier years of her reign. She was,
      in the opinion of the Pope and probably of all the European Powers,
      Romanist and Protestant, illegitimate; and heresy combined with bastardy
      was a terrible weapon in the hands of Henry <span class="smcap">II.</span> of
      France, who meant to support the claims of his daughter-in-law, the
      young Queen of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg
      388]</a></span> Scots,&mdash;undoubtedly the lawful heir in the eyes
      of all who believed that Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> had
      been lawfully married to Catharine of Aragon. The Spanish Ambassador,
      Count de Feria, tried to frighten Elizabeth by reminding her how, in
      consequence of a papal excommunication, Navarre had been seized by
      the King of Spain.<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> His
      statement to his master, that at her accession two-thirds of the English
      people were Romanists,<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> may
      be questioned (he made many miscalculations), but it is certain that
      England was anything but a united Protestant nation. Still, who knew
      what trouble Philip might have in the Netherlands, and the Lords of
      the Congregation might be encouraged enough to check French designs
      on England through Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> At
      the worst, Philip of Spain would not like to see England wholly in
      the grip of France. The Queen and Cecil made up their minds to take
      the risk, and England was to be Protestant and defy the Pope, from &ldquo;whom
      nothing was to be feared but evil will, cursing, and practising.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul <span class="smcap">IV.</span>, it was said, was prepared to receive
      the news of Elizabeth&rsquo;s succession favourably, perhaps under conditions
      to guarantee her legitimacy; but partly to his astonishment, and certainly
      to his wrath, he was not even officially informed of her accession,
      and the young Queen&rsquo;s ambassador at Rome was told that she had no need
      for him there.</p>
<p>The changes at home, however, were made with all due caution. In Elizabeth&rsquo;s
      first proclamation an &ldquo;et cetera&rdquo;
      veiled any claim to be the Head of the Church,<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> and
      her earliest meddling with ecclesiastical matters was to forbid all
      contentious preaching.<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> The
      statutory religion (Romanist) was to be maintained for the meantime.
      No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span> official
      proclamation was made foreshadowing coming changes.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, however, did not need to depend on proclamations to indicate
      to her people the path she meant to tread. She graciously accepted
      the Bible presented to her on her entry into London, clasped it to
      her bosom, and pressed it to her lips. Her hand ostentatiously shrank
      from the kiss of Bonner the persecutor. The great lawyer, Goderick,
      pointed out ways in which Protestant feeling might find vent in a legal
      manner:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;In the meantime Her Majesty and all her subjects may by licence
            of law use the <i>English Litany</i> and suffrages used in King
            Henry&rsquo;s time, and besides Her Majesty in her closet may use the
            Mass without lifting up the Host according to the ancient canons,
            and may also have at every Mass some communicants with the ministers
            to be used in both kinds.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The advice was acted upon, improved upon. &ldquo;The affairs of religion continue
      as usual,&rdquo; says the Venetian agent (Dec. 17th, 1558), &ldquo;but I hear that
      at Court when the Queen is present a priest officiates, who says certain
      prayers with the Litanies in English, after the fashion of King Edward.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> She
      went to Mass, but asked the Bishop officiating not to elevate the Host
      for adoration; and when he refused to comply, she and her ladies swept
      out of church immediately after the Gospel was read.<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> Parliament
      was opened in the usual manner with the performance of Mass, but the
      Queen did not appear until it was over; and then her procession was
      preceded by a choir which sang hymns in English. When the Abbot of
      Westminster met her in ecclesiastical procession with the usual candles
      sputtering in the hands of his clergy, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg
      390]</a></span> Queen shouted, &ldquo;Away with these torches, we have light
      enough.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a></p>
<p>She was crowned on January 15th, 1559; but whether with <i>all</i> the
      customary ceremonies, it is impossible to say; it is most likely that
      she did not communicate.<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> The
      Bishops swore fealty in the usual way, but were chary of taking any
      official part in the coronation of one so plainly a heretic. Later
      in the day, Dr. Cox, who had been King Edward&rsquo;s tutor, and was one
      of the returned refugees, preached before the Queen. As early as Dec.
      14th (1558) the Spanish Ambassador could report that the Queen &ldquo;is
      every day standing up against religion (Romanism) more openly,&rdquo; and
      that &ldquo;all the heretics who had escaped are beginning to flock back
      again from Germany.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a></p>
<p>When Convocation met it became manifest that the clergy would not help
      the Government in the proposed changes. They declared in favour of
      transubstantiation and of the sacrifice of the Mass, and against the
      royal supremacy. The Reformation, it was seen, must be carried through
      by the civil power exclusively; and it was somewhat difficult to forecast
      what Parliament would consent to do.</p>
<p>What was actually done is still matter of debate, but it seems probable
      that the Government presented at least three Bills. The first was withdrawn;
      the second was wrecked by the Queen withholding her Royal Assent; the
      third resulted in the Act of Supremacy and in the Act of Uniformity.
      It is most likely that the first and second Bills, which did not become
      law, included in <i>one</i> proposed Act of legislation the proposals
      of the Government about the Queen&rsquo;s Supremacy and about Uniformity
      of Public Worship.<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> The
      first was introduced into the House of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg
      391]</a></span> Commons on Feb. 9th (1559), was discussed there Feb.
      13th to 16th, and then withdrawn. A &ldquo;new&rdquo; Bill &ldquo;for the supremacy annexed
      to the Crown&rdquo; was introduced in the Commons on Feb. 21st, passed the
      third reading on the 25th, and was sent to the Lords on the 27th.<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a></p>
<p>The majority in the House of Commons was Protestant;<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> but
      the Marian Bishops had great influence in the House of Lords, and it
      was there that the Government proposals met with strong opposition.
      Dr. Jewel describes the situation in a letter to Peter Martyr (March
      20th):</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;The bishops are a great hindrance to us; for being, as you know,
            among the nobility and leading men in the Upper House, and having
            none there on our side to expose their artifices and confute
            their falsehoods, they reign as sole monarchs in the midst of
            ignorant and weak men, and easily overreach our little party,
            either by their numbers or their reputation for learning. The
            Queen, meanwhile, though she openly favours our cause, yet is
            wonderfully afraid of allowing any innovations.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bill (Bill No. 2&mdash;the &ldquo;new&rdquo; Bill), which had passed the Commons
      on the 25th, was read for the first time in the Lords on the 28th,
      passed the second reading on March 13th, and was referred to a Committee
      consisting of the Duke of Norfolk, the Bishops of Exeter and Carlisle,
      and Lords Winchester, Westmoreland, Shrewsbury, Rutland, Sussex, Pembroke,
      Montagu, Clinton, Morley, Rich, Willoughby, and North. They evidently
      made such alterations on the Bill as to make that part of it at least
      which enforced a radical change in public worship useless for the purpose
      of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span> the
      Government. The clearest account of what the Lords did is contained
      in a letter of a person who signs himself &ldquo;Il Schifanoya,&rdquo; which is
      preserved in the State Archives in Mantua.<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> He
      says:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;Parliament, which ought to have ended last Saturday, was prolonged
            till next Wednesday in Passion Week, and according to report
            they will return a week after Easter (March 26, 1559); which
            report I believe, because of the three principal articles the
            first alone passed, viz. to give the supremacy of the Anglican
            Church to the Queen ... notwithstanding the opposition of the
            bishops, and of the chief lords and barons of this kingdom; but
            the Earls of Arundel and Derby, who are very good Christians,
            absented themselves from indisposition, feigned, as some think,
            to avoid consulting about such ruin of this realm.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;The Earl of Pembroke, the Earl of Shrewsbury, Viscount Montague
            and Lord Hastings did not fail in their duty, like true soldiers
            of Christ, to resist the Commons, whom they compelled to modify <i>a
            book passed by the Commons forbidding the Mass to be said or
            the Communion to be administered (ne se communicassero) except
            at the table in the manner of Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span></i>;
            nor were the Divine offices to be performed in church; priests
            likewise being allowed to marry, and the Christian religion and
            the Sacraments being absolutely abolished; adding thereto many
            extraordinary penalties against delinquents. By a majority of
            votes they have decided that the aforesaid things shall be expunged
            from the book, and that the Masses, Sacraments, and the rest
            of the Divine offices shall be performed as hitherto.... The
            members of the Lower House, seeing that the Lords passed this
            article of the Queen&rsquo;s supremacy of the Church, but not as the
            Commons drew it up,&mdash;the Lords cancelling the aforesaid
            clauses and modifying some others,&mdash;grew angry, and would
            consent to nothing, but are in very great controversy.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lords, induced by the Marian Bishops, had wrecked the Government&rsquo;s
      plan for an alteration of religion.</p>
<p>The Queen then intervened. She refused her assent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg
                  393]</a></span> to the Bill, on the dexterous pretext that
                  she had doubts about the title which it proposed to confer
                  upon her&mdash;<i>Supreme Head of the Church</i>.<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> She
                  knew that Romanists and Calvinists both disliked it, and
                  she adroitly managed to make both parties think that she
                  had yielded to the arguments which each had brought forward.
                  The Spanish Ambassador took all the credit to himself;
                  and Sandys was convinced that Elizabeth had been persuaded
                  by Mr. Lever, who &ldquo;had put a scruple into the Queen&rsquo;s head
                  that she would not take the title of Supreme Head.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a></p>
<p>The refusal of Royal Assent enabled the Government to start afresh. They
      no longer attempted to put everything in one Bill. A new Act of Supremacy,<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> in
      which the Queen was declared to be &ldquo;the only supreme governor of this
      realm ... as well in all spiritual or ecclesiastical things or causes
      as temporal,&rdquo; was introduced into the Commons on April 10th, and was
      read for a third time on the 13th. Brought into the Lords on April
      14th, it was read for a second time on the 17th, and finally passed
      on April 29th. If the obnoxious title was omitted, all the drastic
      powers claimed by Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> were given
      to Elizabeth. The Elizabethan Act revived no less than nine of the
      Acts of Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>,<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> and
      among them the statute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg
      394]</a></span> concerning doctors of civil law,<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> which
      contained these sentences: &ldquo;Most royal majesty is and hath always been,
      by the Word of God, Supreme Head on earth of the Church of England,
      and hath full power and authority to correct, punish, and repress all
      manner of heresies ... and to exercise all other manner of jurisdiction
      commonly called ecclesiastical jurisdiction&rdquo;; and his majesty is &ldquo;the
      only and undoubted Supreme Head of the Church of England, and also
      of Ireland, to whom by Holy Scripture all authority and power is wholly
      given to hear and determine all manner of causes ecclesiastical.&rdquo; Thus
      the very title Supreme Head of the Church of England was revived and
      bestowed on Elizabeth by this Parliament of 1559. It may even be said
      that the ecclesiastical jurisdiction bestowed upon Elizabeth was more
      extensive than that given to her father, for <i>schisms</i> were added
      to the list of matters subject to the Queen&rsquo;s correction, and she was
      empowered to delegate her authority to commissioners&mdash;a provision
      which enabled her to exercise her supreme governorship in a way to
      be felt in every corner of the land.<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> This
      Act of Supremacy revived an Act of King Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span>,
      enjoining that the communion should be given in both &ldquo;kinds,&rdquo; and declared
      that the revived Act should take effect from the last day of Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> It
      contained an interesting proviso that nothing should be judged to be
      heresy which was not condemned by canonical Scripture, or by the first
      four General Councils
      &ldquo;or any of them.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a></p>
<p>The same Parliament, after briefer debate (April 18th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg
                  395]</a></span> to 28th), passed an Act of Uniformity which
                  took an interesting form.<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> The
                  Act began by declaring that at the death of King Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span> there &ldquo;remained
                  one uniform order of common service and prayer, and of
                  the administration of sacraments, rites, and ceremonies
                  in the Church of England, which was set forth in one Book,
                  entitled <i>The Book of Common Prayer and Administration
                  of the Sacraments and other Rites and Ceremonies in the
                  Church of England</i>.&rdquo; This Book had been authorised by
                  Act of Parliament held in the fifth and sixth years of
                  King Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span>, and this Act
                  had been repealed by an Act of Parliament in the first
                  year of the reign of Queen Mary
      &ldquo;to the great decay of the due honour of God, and discomfort of the
      professors of the truth of Christ&rsquo;s religion.&rdquo;
      This Act of Queen Mary was solemnly repealed, and the Act of King Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span>,
      with some trifling alterations, was restored. In consequence, &ldquo;all
      and singular ministers in any cathedral or parish church&rdquo; were ordered &ldquo;to
      say and use the Matins, Evensong, celebration of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper,
      and administration of each of the sacraments, and all their common
      and open prayer, in such order and form as is mentioned in the said
      Book, so authorised by Parliament in the said fifth and sixth years
      of the reign of King Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span>, with one
      alteration or addition of certain lessons to be used on every Sunday
      in the year, and the form of the Litany altered and corrected, and
      two sentences only added in the delivery of the sacrament to the communicants,
      and none other or otherwise.&rdquo; This meant that while there might be
      the fullest freedom of thought in the country and a good deal of liberty
      of expression, there was to be no freedom of public worship. All Englishmen,
      of whatever creed, were to be compelled by law to join in one common
      public worship according to the ritual prescribed. The Act of Parliament
      which compelled them to this had no specific Book of Common Prayer
      annexed to it and incorporated in it. It simply replaced on the Statute
      Book the Act of King Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span>, and with
      it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span> the
      Second Prayer-Book of King Edward, which with its rubrics had been &ldquo;annexed
      and joined&rdquo; to that Act<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a>&mdash;certain
      specified alterations in the Book being notified in the Elizabethan
      Act.</p>
<p>The history of the Elizabethan Prayer-Book is confessedly obscure. If
      an important paper called the <i>Device</i>,<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> probably
      drafted by Cecil, embodied the intentions of the Government, their
      procedure may be guessed with some probability. It enumerates carefully,
      after the manner of the great Elizabethan statesman, the dangers involved
      in any &ldquo;alteration of religion,&rdquo; and shows how they can be met or averted.
      France and Scotland can be treated diplomatically. Rome may be left
      unheeded&mdash;it is far away, and its opposition will not go beyond &ldquo;evil
      will and cursing.&rdquo; The important dangers were at home. They would come
      from two sides&mdash;from the Romanists backed by most of the higher
      clergy; and from the advanced Reformers, who would scoff at the alteration
      which is alone possible in the condition of the kingdom, and would
      call it a &ldquo;cloaked papistry and a mingle-mangle.&rdquo; Yet both may be overcome
      by judicious firmness. The Romanists may be coerced by penal laws.
      The danger from the advanced Reformers may be got over by a carefully
      drafted Prayer-Book, <i>made as far as possible to their liking</i>,
      and enforced by such penalties as would minimise all objections. There
      is great hope that such penalties would &ldquo;touch but few.&rdquo;
      &ldquo;And better it were that they did suffer than Her Highness or Commonwealth
      should shake or be in danger.&rdquo;
      The <i>Device</i> suggested that a small committee of seven divines&mdash;all
      of them well-known Reformers, and most of them refugees&mdash;should
      prepare a Book &ldquo;which, being approved by Her Majesty,&rdquo; might be laid
      before Parliament. It was evidently believed that the preparation of
      the Book would take some time, for suggestion is made that food, drink,
      wood, and coals should be provided for their sustenance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg
      397]</a></span> and comfort. There is no direct evidence to show that
      the suggested committee met or was even appointed; but evidence has
      been brought forward to show that most of the theologians named were
      in London, and were in a position to meet together and consult during
      the period when such a Book would naturally be prepared.<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> The
      whole matter is shrouded in mystery, and secrecy was probably necessary
      in the circumstances. No one knew exactly what was to take place; but
      some change was universally expected. &ldquo;There is a general expectation
      that all rites and ceremonies will shortly be reformed,&rdquo;
      said Richard Hilles, writing to Bullinger in the end of February (1559), &ldquo;by
      our faithful citizens and other godly men in the afore-mentioned Parliament,
      either after the pattern which was lately in use in the time of King
      Edward the Sixth, or which is set forth by the Protestant Princes of
      Germany in the afore-mentioned Confession of Augsburg.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a></p>
<p>The authorities kept their own counsel, and nothing definite was known
      to outsiders. A Book was presented to the Commons&mdash;<i>The Book
      of Common Prayer and Ministration of the Sacraments</i>&mdash;on Feb.
      16th, at the time when the first draft of the Supremacy Bill was being
      discussed.<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> It
      must have been withdrawn along with that Bill. The second attempt at
      a Supremacy Act was probably accompanied with a Prayer-Book annexed
      to the Bill; and this Prayer-Book was vehemently opposed in the Lords,
      who struck out all the clauses relating to it.<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> What
      this Book of Common Prayer was, cannot be exactly known. Many competent
      liturgist scholars are inclined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg
      398]</a></span> to believe that it was something more drastic than
      the Edwardine Prayer-Book of 1552, and that it was proposed to enforce
      it by penalties more drastic than those enacted by the Act of Uniformity
      which finally passed. They find the characteristic features of the
      Book in the well-known letter of Guest (Geste) to Cecil.<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> Such
      suggestions are mere conjectures. The Book may have been the Edwardine
      Prayer-Book of 1552.</p>
<p>The Government had made slow progress with their proposed &ldquo;alteration
      of religion,&rdquo; and the Protestant party were chafing at the delay. Easter
      was approaching, and its nearness made them more impatient. Canon law
      required everyone to communicate on Easter Day, which in 1559 fell
      on the 26th of March, and by a long established custom the laity of
      England had gone to the Lord&rsquo;s Table on that one day of the year. Men
      were asking whether it was possible that a whole year was to elapse
      before they could partake of the communion in a Protestant fashion.
      The House of Commons was full of this Protestant sentiment. The reactionary
      proceedings in the House of Lords urged them to some protest.<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> A
      Bill was introduced into the Lower House declaring that
      &ldquo;no person shall be punished for now using the religion used in King
      Edward&rsquo;s <i>last</i> year.&rdquo; It was read twice and engrossed in one
      day (March 15th), and was read a third time and passed on March 18th.<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> It
      does not appear to have been before the Lords; but it was acted on
      in a curious way. A proclamation, dated March 22nd, declares that the
      Queen, &ldquo;with the assent of Lords and Commons,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg
      399]</a></span> in the &ldquo;present last session,&rdquo; has revived the Act
      of King Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span> touching the reception
      of the Communion in both &ldquo;kinds,&rdquo; and explains that the Act cannot
      be ready for Easter. It proceeds: &ldquo;And because the time of Easter is
      so at hand, and that great numbers, not only of the noblemen and gentry,
      but also of the common people of this realm, be certainly persuaded
      in conscience in such sort as they cannot be induced in any wise to
      communicate or receive the said holy Sacrament but under both kinds,
      according to the first institution, and to the common use both of the
      Apostles and of the Primitive Church ... it is thought necessary to
      Her Majesty, by the advice of sundry of her nobility and commons lately
      assembled in Parliament,&rdquo; to declare that the statute of Edward is
      in force, and all and sundry are commanded to observe the provisions
      of the statute.<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> What
      is more, the Queen acted upon her proclamation. The well-informed &ldquo;Schifanoya,&rdquo;
      writing on March 28th, says that the Government
      &ldquo;during this interval&rdquo; (i.e. between March 22nd and March 28th) had
      ordered and printed a proclamation for every one to take the communion
      in both &ldquo;kinds&rdquo; (<i>sub utraque specie</i>). He goes on to say that
      on Easter Day &ldquo;Her Majesty appeared in chapel, where Mass was sung
      in English, <i>according to the use of her brother, King Edward</i>,
      and the communion received in both &lsquo;kinds,&rsquo; kneeling.&rdquo;
      The chaplain wore nothing &ldquo;but the mere surplice&rdquo; (<i>la semplice cotta</i>).<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> The
      news went the round of Europe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg
      400]</a></span> Elizabeth had at last declared herself unmistakably
      on the Protestant side.</p>
<p>Easter had come and gone, and the religious question had not received
      final settlement. The authorities felt that something must be done
      to counteract the speeches of the Romanist partisans in the Lords.<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> So,
      while Parliament was sitting, a conference was arranged between Roman
      Catholic and Protestant divines. It seems to have been welcomed by
      both parties. Count Feria, the Spanish Ambassador, declared that he
      had something to do with it. He was anxious that the disputation should
      be in Latin, that the arguments should be reduced to writing, and that
      each disputant should sign his paper. He was overruled so far as the
      language was concerned. The authorities meant that the laity should
      hear and understand. The three questions debated were:&mdash;Whether
      a &ldquo;particular Church can change rites and ceremonies; Whether the services
      of public worship must be conducted in Latin; Whether the Mass is a
      propitiatory sacrifice.&rdquo; The conference was held at Westminster on
      March 31st, in presence of the Privy Council, the Lords and Commons,
      and the
      &ldquo;multitude.&rdquo; Great expectations were cherished by both parties in anticipation,
      and when the Romanist divines withdrew on points of procedure, their
      cause suffered in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg
      401]</a></span> popular estimation. Two of the Bishops were sent to
      the Tower &ldquo;for open contempt and contumacy&rdquo;; and others seem to have
      been threatened.<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a></p>
<p>Parliament reassembled after the Easter recess and passed the Act of Supremacy
      in its third form, and the Act of Uniformity, which re-enacted, as
      has been said, the revised Prayer-Book&mdash;that is, the Second Book
      of King Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span> with the distinctly specified
      alterations. The most important of these changes were the two sentences
      added to the words to be used by the officiating minister when giving
      the communion. The clauses had been in the First Prayer-Book of Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span></p>
<p>While in the Second Prayer-Book of King Edward the officiating minister
      was commanded to say while giving the Bread:</p>
<p class="blockquot"><i>&ldquo;Take and eat this, in remembrance that Christ died
            for thee, and feed on Him in thy heart by faith with thanksgiving,&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>and while giving the Cup, to say:</p>
<p class="blockquot"><i>&ldquo;Drink this in remembrance that Christ&rsquo;s blood was
            shed for thee, and be thankful;&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>the words were altered in the Elizabethan book to:</p>
<p class="blockquot"><i>&ldquo;The Body of our Lord Jesus Christ, which was given
            for thee, preserve thy body and soul unto everlasting life. Take
            and eat this in remembrance that Christ died for thee, and feed

<p class="blockquot">&ldquo;<i>The Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, which was shed
            for thee, preserve thy body and soul unto everlasting life. Drink
            this in remembrance that Christ&rsquo;s Blood was shed for thee, and
            be thankful.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The additions in no way detracted from the Evangelical doctrine of the
      Sacrament. They rather brought the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg
      402]</a></span> underlying thought, into greater harmony with the doctrine
      of the Reformed Churches. But they have had the effect of enabling
      men who hold different views about the nature of the rite to join in
      its common use.</p>
<p>When the Act of Uniformity was passed by Parliament, the advanced Reformers,
      who had chafed at what appeared to them to be a long delay, were contented.
      They, one and all, believed that the Church of England had been restored
      to what it had been during the last year of the reign of Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span>;
      and this was the end for which they had been striving, the goal placed
      before them by their friend and adviser, Henry Bullinger of Zurich.<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> Their
      letters are full of jubilation.<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a></p>
<p>Yet there were some things about this Elizabethan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg
                  403]</a></span> settlement which, <i>if</i> interpreted
                  as they have been by some ecclesiastical historians, make
                  it very difficult to understand the contentment of such
                  men as Grindal, Jewel, and Sandys. &ldquo;Of what was done in
                  the matter of <i>ornaments</i>,&rdquo; says Professor Maitland, &ldquo;by
                  statute, by the rubrics of the Book, and by <i>Injunctions</i> that
                  the Queen promptly issued, it would be impossible to speak
                  fairly without lengthy quotation of documents, the import
                  of which became in the nineteenth century a theme of prolonged
                  and inconclusive disputation.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> All
                  that can be attempted here is to mention the principal
                  documents involved in the later controversy, and to show
                  how they were interpreted in the life and conduct of contemporaries.</p>
<p>The Act of Uniformity had restored, with some trifling differences clearly
      and definitely stated, Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span>&rsquo;s Prayer-Book
      of 1552, and therefore its rubrics.<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> It
      had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span> at
      the same time contained a proviso saying that the <i>ornaments</i> sanctioned
      by the authority of Parliament in the second year of Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span> were &ldquo;to
      be retained and be in use&rdquo; &ldquo;until further order shall therein be taken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Men like Grindal and Jewel took no exception to this proviso, which they
      certainly would have done had they believed that it ordained the actual
      use in time of public worship, of the ornaments used in the second
      year of King Edward. The interpretation they gave to the proviso is
      seen from a letter from Sandys to Parker (afterwards Archbishop of
      Canterbury), written two days after the Act of Uniformity had passed
      the Lords. He says:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;The last book of service has gone through with a proviso to retain
            the ornaments which were used in the first and second year of
            King Edward, until it please the Queen to take other order for
            them. Our gloss upon the text is that we shall not be enforced
            to use them, but that others in the meantime shall not convey
            them away, but that they may remain for the Queen.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sandys and others understood the proviso to mean that recalcitrant clergy
      like the Warden of Manchester, who carried his consecrated vestments
      to Ireland, were not to make off with the ornaments, and that churchwardens
      or patrons were not to confiscate them for their private use. They
      were property belonging to the Queen, and to be retained until her
      Majesty&rsquo;s pleasure was known. The whole history of the visitations
      goes to prove that Sandys&rsquo; interpretation of the proviso was that of
      its framers.</p>
<p>When the Prayer-Book was actually printed it was found to contain some
      differences from the Edwardine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg
      405]</a></span> Book of 1552 besides those mentioned in the Act as
      the only ones to be admitted; and early editions have not always the
      same changes. But the one thing of importance was a rubric which, on
      what seems to be the only possible interpretation, enjoins the use
      in public worship of the ornaments (<i>i.e.</i> the vestments) in use
      in the second year of King Edward.<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> How
      this rubric got into the Prayer-Book it is impossible to say. It certainly
      was not enacted by the Queen &ldquo;with assent of Lords and Commons.&rdquo;
      We have no proof that it was issued by the Privy Council.<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg
      406]</a></span> The use and wont of the Church of England during the
      period of the Elizabethan settlement was as if this rubric had never
      existed. It is directly contradicted by the thirtieth Injunction issued
      for the Royal Visitation of 1559.<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> It
      was not merely contemptuously ignored by the Elizabethan Bishops; they
      compelled their clergy, if compulsion was needed, to act in defiance
      of it.</p>
<p>Contemporary sources abundantly testify that in the earlier years of the
      reign of Queen Elizabeth the English clergy in their ministrations
      scarcely ever wore any ecclesiastical garment but the surplice; and
      sometimes not even that. The <i>Advertisements</i><a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> of
      1566, which almost all contemporary notices speak of as prescribing
      what had been enjoined in the Injunctions of 1559, were drafted for
      the purpose of coercing clergymen who were in the habit of refusing
      to wear even the surplice, and they enjoined the surplice only, and
      the cope<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> in
      cathedrals. In the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
Visitation carried out in accordance with the directions in the Injunctions,
      a clean sweep was made of almost all the <i>ornaments</i> which were
      not merely permitted but ordered in the proviso of the Act of Uniformity
      and the Rubric of 1559 on the ordinary ritualistic interpretation of
      these clauses. The visitors proceeded on a uniform plan, and what we
      hear was done in one place may be inferred as the common practice.
      The Spanish Ambassador (July or August 1559) wrote to his master: &ldquo;They
      are now carrying out the law of Parliament respecting religion with
      great rigour, and have appointed six visitors.... They have just taken
      the crosses, images, and altars from St. Paul&rsquo;s and all the other London
      churches.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> A
      citizen of London noted in his diary: &ldquo;The time before Bartholomew
      tide and after, were all the roods and Maries and Johns, and many other
      of the church goods, both copes, crosses, censers, altar cloth, rood
      cloths, books, banners, banner stays, wainscot and much other gear
      about London, burnt in Smithfield.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> What
      took place in London was done in the provinces. At Grantham, &ldquo;the vestments,
      copes, albs, tunicles, and all other such baggages were defaced and
      openly sold by the general consent of the whole corporation, and the
      money employed in setting up desks in the church, and making of a decent
      communion table, and the remnant to the poor.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a></p>
<p>It is true that we find complaints on the part of men like Jewel of ritualistic
      practices which they do not like; but these in almost every case refer
      to worship in the royal chapel. The services there were well known,
      and both friends and foes of the Reformation seemed to take it for
      granted that what was the fashion in the royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg
      408]</a></span> chapel would soon extend to the rest of the realm.<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> Historians
      have usually attributed the presence of crosses, vestments, lights
      on the altar, to the desire of the Queen to conciliate her Romanist
      subjects, or to stand well with the great Roman Catholic Powers of
      Europe. It is quite likely that the Queen had this thought in her mind.
      Elizabeth was a thrifty lady, and liked to bring down many birds with
      the one stone. But the one abiding thought in the mind of the astute
      Queen was to stand well with the Lutherans, and to be able, when threatened
      with papal excommunication, to take shelter under the &aelig;gis of
      the Peace of Augsburg.</p>
<p>When the Government had secured the passing of the Acts of Supremacy and
      Uniformity, they were in a position to deal with the recalcitrant clergy.
      Eleven of the English Episcopal Sees had been vacant at the accession
      of Elizabeth, among them that of the Primate; for Cardinal Pole had
      died a few hours after Mary, In the summer and autumn of 1559 the sixteen
      Bishops were called upon to sign the Oath of Supremacy, in which the
      papal rule over the Church of England was abjured, and the Queen declared
      to be the Supreme Governor of the Church. All the Bishops, more or
      less definitely, refused to take the oath; although three were at first
      doubtful. They were deprived, and the English Church was practically
      without Bishops.<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> Some
      of the deprived Bishops of King Edward&rsquo;s time survived, and they were
      restored. Then came discussion about the manner of appointing new ones.
      Some would have preferred a simple royal nomination, as in Edward&rsquo;s
      time; but in the end it was resolved that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg
      409]</a></span> appointment should be nominally in the hands of the
      Deans and Chapters according to medi&aelig;val rule, with the proviso,
      however, that the royal permission to elect had first to be given,
      and that the person named in the &ldquo;leave to elect&rdquo; should be chosen.
      Then the question of consecration gave rise to some difficulties; but
      these were got over in ways which were deemed to be sufficient. Matthew
      Parker, after more than one refusal, was nominated and consecrated
      Archbishop of Canterbury. Lists of clerical persons suitable for promotion
      were prepared for the Queen,<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> and
      the other Sees were gradually filled. The Elizabethan episcopate, with
      the exception of the few Edwardine Bishops, was an entirely new creation.
      A large number of the Deans and members of the Cathedral Chapters had
      also refused to sign the Oath of Supremacy; they were deprived, and
      others who were on the lists were appointed in their place. The inferior
      clergy proved to be much more amenable, and only about two hundred
      were in the end deprived. The others all accepted the &ldquo;alteration of
      religion&rdquo;; and the change was brought about quietly and without the
      riotings which had accompanied the alterations made in the days of
      Edward, or the wholesale deprivations which had followed upon those
      made by Queen Mary&mdash;when almost one-third of the beneficed clergy
      of the Church of England had been removed from their benefices. A similar
      passive acquiescence was seen in the introduction of the new Book of
      Common Prayer, and in the fulfilment of the various orders for the
      removal of images, etc. The great altars and crucifixes were taken
      away, and the pictures covered with whitewash, without any disturbances
      to speak of.</p>
<p>The comparative ease with which the &ldquo;alteration of religion&rdquo; was effected
      was no doubt largely due to the increased Protestant feeling of the
      country; but the tact and forbearance of those who were appointed to
      see the changes carried out counted for something; and perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg
      410]</a></span> the acquiescence of the Roman Catholics was due to
      the fact that they had no great leader, that they did not expect the
      Elizabethan settlement to last long, and that they waited in expectation
      that one or other of the two Romanist Powers, France or Spain, would
      interfere in their behalf. The religious revolution in Scotland in
      1560 saved the Elizabethan settlement for the time; and Philip of Spain
      trifled away his opportunities until a united England overthrew his
      Armada, which came thirty years too late.</p>
<p>The change was given effect to by a Royal Visitation. England was divided
      into six districts, and lists of visitors were drawn up which included
      the Lords Lieutenants of the counties, the chief men of the districts,
      and some lawyers and clergymen known to be well affected to the Reformation.
      They had to assist them a set of Injunctions, modelled largely, not
      entirely, on those of Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span>, drafted
      and issued by royal command.<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> The
      members of the clergy were dealt with very patiently, and explanations,
      public and private, were given of the Act of Supremacy which made it
      easier for them to accept it. The Elizabethan Bishops were also evidently
      warned to deal tenderly with stubborn parish clergymen; they would
      have been less patient with them if left to themselves. One, Bishop
      Best, Bishop of Carlisle, is found writing to Cecil about his clergy,
      that &ldquo;the priests are wicked impes of Antichrist,&rdquo;
      for the most part very ignorant and stubborn; another, Pilkington,
      the Bishop of Durham, in describing the disordered state of his diocese,
      declared that &ldquo;like St. Paul, he has to fight with beasts at Ephesus&rdquo;;
      and a third, Scory, Bishop of Winchester, wrote that he was much hindered
      by justices of the peace who were Roman Catholics, and that when certain
      priests who had refused to take the oath were driven out of Exeter
      and elsewhere, they were received and feasted in the streets with torch-lights.<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a></p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></p>
<p>Elizabeth&rsquo;s second Parliament was very much more Protestant than the first,
      and insisted that the Oath of Supremacy must be taken by all the members
      of the House of Commons, by all lawyers, and by all schoolmasters.
      The Convocation of 1563 proved that the clergy desired to go much further
      in the path of Reformation than the Queen thought desirable.</p>
<p>They clearly wished for some doctrinal standard, and Archbishop Parker
      had prepared and laid before Convocation a revised edition of the <i>Forty-two
      Articles</i> which had defined the theology of the Church of England
      in the last year of King Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span><a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> The
      way had been prepared for the issue of some authoritative exposition
      of the doctrinal position of the Elizabethan Church by the <i>Declaration
      of the Principal Articles of Religion</i>&mdash;a series of eleven
      articles framed by the Bishops and published in 1561 (March), which
      repudiates strongly the Romanist doctrines of the Papacy, private Masses,
      and the propitiatory sacrifice in the Holy Supper. The Spanish Ambassador,
      who had heard of the meetings of the Bishops for this purpose, imagined
      that they were preparing articles to be presented to the Council of
      Trent on behalf of the Church of England.<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> The
      Archbishop&rsquo;s draft was revised by Convocation, and was &ldquo;diligently
      read and sifted&rdquo; by the Queen herself before she gave her consent to
      the authoritative publication of the Articles.</p>
<p>These <i>Thirty-nine Articles</i> expressed the doctrine of the Reformed
      or Calvinist as distinguished from the Evangelical or Lutheran form
      of Protestant doctrine, and the distinction lay mainly in the views
      which the respective Confessions of the two Churches held about the
      Presence of Christ in the Sacrament of the Holy Supper. By this time
      (1562) Zwinglianism, as a doctrinal system, not as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg
      412]</a></span> an ecclesiastical policy, had disappeared;<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> and
      the three theories of the Presence of Christ in the Sacrament had all
      to do with the Presence of the Body of Christ and not with a spiritual
      Presence simply. The Romanist theory, transubstantiation, was based
      on the medi&aelig;val conception of a substance existing apart from
      all accidents of smell, shape, colour, etc., and declared that the
      &ldquo;substance&rdquo; of the Bread and of the Wine was changed into the &ldquo;substance&rdquo; of
      the Body and Blood of Christ, while the accidents or qualities remained
      the same&mdash;the change being miraculously effected by the priest
      in consecrating the communion elements. The Lutheran explanation was
      based upon a medi&aelig;val theory also&mdash;on that of the ubiquity
      or natural omnipresence of the &ldquo;glorified&rdquo;
      Body of Christ. The Body of Christ, in virtue of its ubiquity, was
      present everywhere, in chairs, tables, stones flung through the air
      (to use Luther&rsquo;s illustrations), and therefore in the Bread and in
      the Wine as everywhere else. This ordinary presence became an efficacious
      sacramental Presence owing to the promise of God. Calvin had discarded
      both medi&aelig;val theories, and started by asking what was meant
      by <i>substance</i> and what by <i>presence</i>; he answered that the
      substance of anything is its power (<i>vis</i>), and its presence is
      the immediate application of its power. Thus the substance of the crucified
      Body of Christ is its power, and the Presence of the crucified Body
      of Christ is the immediate application of its power; and the guarantee
      of the application of the power is the promise of God received by the
      believing communicant. By discarding the Lutheran thought that the
      substance of the Body of Christ is something extended in space, and
      accepting the thought that the main thing in substance is power, Calvin
      was able to think of the substance of the Body of Christ in a way somewhat
      similar to the medi&aelig;val conception of &ldquo;substance without accidents,&rdquo; and
      was able to show that the Presence of Christ&rsquo;s Body in the sacrament
      could be accepted and understood without the priestly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg
      413]</a></span> miracle, which he and all Protestants rejected. Hence
      it came to pass that Calvin could teach the Real Presence of Christ&rsquo;s
      Body in the Sacrament of the Supper without having recourse to the
      medi&aelig;val doctrine of &ldquo;ubiquity,&rdquo;
      which was the basis of the Lutheran theory. They both (Calvin and Luther)
      insisted on the Presence of the Body of Christ; but the one (Luther)
      needed the theory of
      &ldquo;ubiquity&rdquo; to explain the Presence, while the other (Calvin) did not
      need it. But as both discarded the priestly miracle while insisting
      on the Presence of the Body, the two doctrines might be stated in almost
      the same words, provided all mention of &ldquo;ubiquity&rdquo; was omitted. Calvin
      could and did sign the Augsburg Confession; but he did not read into
      it what a Lutheran would have done, the theory of &ldquo;ubiquity&rdquo;; and a
      Calvinist statement of the doctrine, provided only &ldquo;ubiquity&rdquo; was not
      denied, might be accepted by a Lutheran as not differing greatly from
      his own. Bishop Jewel asserts again and again in his correspondence,
      that the Elizabethan divines did not believe in the theory of &ldquo;ubiquity,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> and
      many of them probably desired to say so in their articles of religion.
      Hence in the first draft of the Thirty-nine Articles presented to Convocation
      by Archbishop Parker, Article XXVIII. contained a strong repudiation
      of the doctrine of &ldquo;ubiquity,&rdquo; which, if retained, would have made
      the Articles of the Church of England more anti-Lutheran than even
      the second Helvetic Confession. The clause was struck out in Convocation,
      probably because it was thought to be needlessly offensive to the German
      Protestants.<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> The
      Queen, however, was not satisfied with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg
      414]</a></span> what her divines had done, and two important interferences
      with the Articles as they came from Convocation are attributed to her.
      The first was the addition of the words: <i>and authoritie in controversies
      of fayth</i>, in Article XX., which deals with the authority possessed
      by the Church. The second was the complete suppression for the time
      being of Article XXIX., which is entitled, <i>Of the wicked which do
      not eate the Body of Christe in the use of the Lordes Supper</i>, and
      is expressed in terms which most Lutherans would have been loath to
      use.</p>
<p>The Queen&rsquo;s action was probably due to political reasons. It was important
      in international politics for a Protestant Queen not yet securely seated
      on her throne to shelter herself under the shield which a profession
      of Lutheranism would give. The German Lutherans had won legal recognition
      within the Empire at the Diet of Augsburg in 1555; the votes of two
      Lutheran Electors had helped to place the Emperor on his throne; and
      the Pope dared not excommunicate Lutheran Princes save at the risk
      of offending the Emperor and invalidating all his acts. This had been
      somewhat sternly pointed out to him when he first threatened to excommunicate
      Elizabeth, and the Queen knew all the difficulties of the papal position.
      One has only to read an account of a long conversation with her, reported
      by the Spanish Ambassador to his master (April 29th, 1559), to see
      what use the
      &ldquo;wise Queen with the eyes that could flash&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> made
      of the situation. The Ambassador had not obscurely threatened her with
      a papal Bull declaring her a bastard and a heretic, and had brought
      home its effects by citing the case of the King of Navarre, whose kingdom
      was taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg
      415]</a></span> from him by Ferdinand of Spain acting as the Pope&rsquo;s
      agent, and Elizabeth had played with him in her usual way. She had
      remarked casually &ldquo;that she wished the Augsburg Confession to be maintained
      in her realm, whereat,&rdquo; says the Count de Feria, &ldquo;I was much surprised,
      and found fault with it all I could, adducing the arguments I thought
      might dissuade her from it. She then told me it would not be the Augsburg
      Confession, but something else like it, and that she differed very
      little from us, as she believed that <i>God was in the Sacrament of
      the Eucharist</i>, and only dissented from three or four things in
      the Mass. After this she told me that she did not wish to argue about
      religious matters.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> She
      did not need to argue; the hint had been enough for the baffled Ambassador.</p>
<p>Article XXIX. was suppressed, and only <i>Thirty-eight Articles</i> were
      acknowledged publicly. The papal Bull of excommunication was delayed
      until 1570, when its publication could harm no one but Elizabeth&rsquo;s
      own Romanist subjects, and the dangerous period was tided over safely.
      When it came at last, the Queen was not anathematised in terms which
      could apply to Lutherans, but because she personally acknowledged and
      observed &ldquo;the impious constitutions and atrocious mysteries of Calvin,&rdquo;
      and had commanded that they should be observed by her subjects.<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> Then,
      when the need for politic suppression was past, Article XXIX. was published,
      and the <i>Thirty-nine Articles</i> became the recognised doctrinal
      standard of the Church of England (1571).</p>
<p>What the Queen&rsquo;s own doctrinal beliefs were no one can tell; and she herself
      gave the most contrary descriptions when it suited her policy. The
      disappearance and reappearance of crosses and candles on the altar
      of the royal chapel were due as much to the wish to keep in touch with
      the Lutherans as to any desire to conciliate the Queen&rsquo;s Romanist subjects.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></p>
<p>The Convocation of 1563 had other important matters before it. Its proceedings
      showed that the new Elizabethan clergy contained a large number who
      were in favour of some drastic changes in the Prayer-Book and in the
      Act of Uniformity. Many of them had become acquainted with and had
      come to like the simplicity of the Swiss worship, thoroughly purified
      from what they called &ldquo;the dregs of Popery&rdquo;; and others envied the
      Scots, &ldquo;who,&rdquo; wrote Parkhurst to Bullinger (Aug. 23rd, 1559), &ldquo;have
      made greater progress in true religion in a few months than we have
      done in many years.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a></p>
<p>Such men were dissatisfied with much in the Prayer-Book, or rather in
      its rubrics, and brought forward proposals for simplifying the worship,
      which received a large measure of support. It was thought that all
      organs should be done away with; that the ceremony of &ldquo;crossing&rdquo;
      in baptism should be omitted; that all festival days save the Sundays
      and the &ldquo;principal feasts of the Church&rdquo;
      should be abolished;&mdash;this proposal was lost by a majority of
      one in the Lower House. Another motion, leaving it to the option of
      communicants to receive the Holy Supper either standing, sitting, or
      kneeling, as it pleased them, was lost by a very small majority. Many
      of the Bishops themselves were in favour of simplifying the rites of
      the Church; and five Deans and twelve Archdeacons petitioned against
      the use of the surplice. The movement was so strong that Convocation,
      if left to itself, would probably have purified the Church in the Puritan
      sense of the word. But the Queen had all the Tudor liking for a stately
      ceremonial, and she had political reasons, national and international,
      to prevent her allowing any drastic changes. She was bent on welding
      her nation together into one, and she had to capture for her Church
      the large mass of people who were either neutral or who had leanings
      to Romanism, or at least to the old medi&aelig;val service. The Council
      of Trent was sitting; Papal excommunication was always threatened,
      and, as above explained, Lutheran protection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg
      417]</a></span> and sympathy were useful. The ceremonies were retained,
      the crucifixes and lights on the altars were paraded in the chapel
      royal to show the Lutheran sympathies of the Queen and of the Church
      of England. The Reforming Bishops, with many an inward qualm,<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> had
      to give way; and gradually, as the Queen had hoped, a strong Conservative
      instinct gathered round the Prayer-Book and its rubrics. The Convocation
      of 1563 witnessed the last determined attempt to propose any substantial
      alteration in the public worship of the English people.</p>
<p>At the same Convocation a good deal of time was spent upon a proposed
      Book of Discipline, or an authoritative statement of the English canon
      law. It is probable that its contents are to be found in certain &ldquo;<i>Articles
      for government and order in the Church, exhibited to be permitted by
      authority; but not allowed</i>,&rdquo; which are printed by Strype<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> from
      Archbishop Parker&rsquo;s MSS. Such a book would have required parliamentary
      authority, and the Parliament of 1563 was too much occupied with the
      vanishing protection of Spain and with the threatening aspect of France
      and Scotland. The marriage of the Queen of Scots with Darnley had given
      additional weight to her claims on the English throne; and it was feared
      that the English Romanists might rise in support of the legitimate
      heir. Parliament almost in a panic passed severe laws against all recusants,
      and increased the penalties against all who refused the oath of allegiance
      or who spoke in support of the authority of the Bishop of Rome. The
      discipline of the Church was left to be regulated by the old statute
      of Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span>, which declared that as much
      of the medi&aelig;val canon law as was not at variance with the Scriptures
      and the Acts of the English Parliament was to form the basis of law
      for the ecclesiastical courts. This gave the Bishop&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg
      418]</a></span> officials who presided over the ecclesiastical courts
      a very free hand; and under their manipulation there was soon very
      little left of the canon law&mdash;less, in fact, than in the ecclesiastical
      courts of any other Protestant Churches. For these officials were lawyers
      trained in civil law and imbued with its principles, and predisposed
      to apply them whenever it was possible to do so.</p>
<p>The formulation of the <i>Thirty-nine Articles</i> in the Convocation
      of 1563 may be taken as marking the time when the &ldquo;alteration of religion&rdquo; was
      completed. The result, arrived at during a period of exceptional storm
      and strain, has had the qualities of endurance, and the Church of England
      is at present what the Queen made it. It was the Royal Supremacy which
      secured for High Church Anglicans the position they have to-day. The
      chief features of the settlement of religion were:</p>
<p>1. The complete repudiation within the realm and Church of England of
      the authority of the Bishop of Rome. All the clergy and everyone holding
      office under the Crown had to swear to this repudiation. If they refused,
      or were recusants in the language of the day, they lost their offices
      and benefices; if they persisted in their refusal, they were liable
      to forfeit all their personal property; if they declined to take the
      oath for a third time, they could be proclaimed traitors, and were
      liable to the hideous punishments which the age inflicted for that
      crime. But Elizabeth, with all her sternness, was never cruel, and
      no religious revolution was effected with less bloodshed.</p>
<p>2. The sovereign was made the supreme Governor of the Church of England;
      and that the title differed in name only from that assumed by Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> was
      made plain in the following ways:</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Convocation was stript of all independent legislative action,
      and its power to make ecclesiastical laws and regulations was placed
      under strict royal control.<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a></p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Appeals from all ecclesiastical courts, which were themselves
      actually, if not nominally, under the presidency of civil lawyers,
      could be made to royal delegates who might be laymen; and these delegates
      were given very full powers, and could inflict civil punishments in
      a way which had not been permitted to the old medi&aelig;val ecclesiastical
      courts. These powers raised a grave constitutional question in the
      following reigns. The royal delegates became a Court of High Commission,
      which may have been modelled on the Consistories of the German Princes,
      and had somewhat the same powers.</p>
<p>3. One uniform ritual of public worship was prescribed for all Englishmen
      in the Book of Common Prayer with its rubrics, enforced by the Act
      of Uniformity. No liberty of worship was permitted. Any clergyman who
      deviated from this prescribed form of worship was liable to be treated
      as a criminal, and so also were all those who abetted him. No one could,
      under penalties, seek to avoid this public worship. Every subject was
      bound to attend church on Sunday, and to bide the prayers and the preaching,
      or else forfeit the sum of twelvepence to the poor. Obstinate recusants
      or nonconformists might be excommunicated, and all excommunicated persons
      were liable to imprisonment.</p>
<p>4. Although it was said, and was largely true, that there was freedom
      of opinion, still obstinate heretics were liable to be held guilty
      of a capital offence. On the other hand, the Bishops had little power
      to force heretics to stand a trial, and, unless Parliament or Convocation
      ordered it otherwise, only the wilder sectaries were in any danger.<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a></p>
<p>Protestant England grew stronger year by year. The debased copper and
      brass coinage was replaced gradually by honest gold and silver.<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> Manufactures
      were encouraged.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg
      420]</a></span> Merchant adventurers, hiring the Queen&rsquo;s ships, took
      an increasing share in the world-trade with Elizabeth as a partner.<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> Persecuted
      Huguenots and Flemings settled in great numbers in the country, and
      brought with them their thrift and knowledge of mechanical trades to
      enrich the land of their adoption;<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> and
      the oppressed Protestants of France and of the Low Countries learnt
      that there was a land beyond the sea ruled by a &ldquo;wise young Queen&rdquo; which
      might be their city of refuge, and which was ready to aid them, if
      not openly, at least stealthily. England, formerly unarmed, became
      supplied &ldquo;more abundantly than any other country with arms, munitions,
      and artillery.&rdquo; Sound money, enlarged trade, growing wealth, and an
      increasing sense of security, were excellent allies to the cause of
      the Protestant Religion.</p>
<p>So long as Mary of Scotland was in Holyrood and able to command the sympathy,
      if not the allegiance, of the English Roman Catholics, the throne of
      Elizabeth was never perfectly secure; but the danger from Scotland
      was minimised by the jealousy between Catherine de&rsquo; Medici and her
      daughter-in-law, and the Scottish Protestant Lords could always be
      secretly helped. When Philip <span class="smcap">II.</span> of Spain,
      in his slow, hesitating way, which made him always miss the turn of
      the tide, at length resolved to aid Mary to crush her rebels at home
      and to prosecute her claims on England, his interference had no further
      consequences than to afford Elizabeth an honourable pretext for giving
      effectual assistance in the conflict which drove Mary from her throne,
      and made Scotland completely and permanently Protestant.<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h3>REVIVAL OF MEDI&AElig;VAL ANTI-ECCLESIASTICAL MOVEMENTS.</h3>
<p>The revolt of Luther was the occasion for the appearance&mdash;the outbreak,
      it might be called&mdash;of a large amount of irregular independent
      thinking upon religion and theology which had expressed itself sporadically
      during the whole course of the Middle Ages. The great difference between
      the thinkers and their intellectual ancestors who were at war with
      the medi&aelig;val Church life and doctrine, did not consist in the
      expression of anything essentially new, but in the fact that the Renaissance
      had introduced a profound contempt for the intellectual structure of
      ecclesiastical dogma, and that the whole of the sixteenth century was
      instinct with the feeling of individuality and the pride of personal
      existence. The old thoughts were less careful to accommodate themselves
      to the recognised modes of theological statement, they took bolder
      forms of expression, presented sharper outlines, and appeared in more
      definite statements.</p>
<p>Part of this thinking scarcely belongs to ecclesiastical history at all.
      It never became the intellectual basis of an institution; it neither
      stirred nor moulded the lives of masses of men. The leaders of thought
      remained solitary thinkers, surrounded by a loose fringe of followers.
      But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span> as
      there is always something immortal in the forcible expression of human
      thought, their opinions have not died altogether, but have affected
      powerfully all the various branches of the Christian Church at different
      periods and in divers ways. The old conceptions, somewhat disguised,
      perhaps, but still the same, reappear in most systems of speculative
      theology. It therefore demands a brief notice.</p>
<p>The greater portion of this intellectual effervescence, however, did not
      share the same fate. Menno Simons, aided, no doubt, by the winnowing
      fan of persecution, was able to introduce order into the wild fermenting
      elements of Anabaptism, and to form the Baptist Church which has had
      such an honourable history in Europe and America. Fausto Sozzini did
      the same for the heterogeneous mass of anti-Trinitarian thinking, and
      out of the confusion brought the orderly unity of an institutional
      life.</p>
<p>This great mass of crude independent thought may be roughly classified
      as Mystic, or perhaps Pantheist Mystic, Anabaptist, and anti-Trinitarian;
      but the division, so far as the earlier thinkers go, is very artificial.
      The groups continually overlap; many of the leaders of thought might
      be placed in two or in all three of these divisions. What characterised
      them all was that they had little sense of historical continuity, cared
      nothing for it, and so broke with the past completely; that they despaired
      of seeing any good in the historical Church, and believed that it must
      be ended, as it was impossible to mend it; and that they all possessed
      a strong sense of individuality, believing the human soul to be imprisoned
      when it accepted the confinement of a common creed, institution, or
      form of service unless of the very simplest kind.</p>
<p>Pantheistic Mysticism was no new thing in Christianity. As early as the
      sixth century at least, schools of thought may be found which interpreted
      such doctrines as the Trinity and the Person of Christ in ways which
      led to what must be called Pantheism; and if such modes of dissolving
      Christian doctrines had not a continuous succession within the Christian
      Church, they were always appearing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg
      423]</a></span> They were generally accompanied with a theory of an
      &ldquo;inner light&rdquo; which claimed either to supersede the Scriptures as the
      Rule of Faith, or at least to interpret them. The Scriptures were the
      husk which might be thrown away when its kernel, discovered by the &ldquo;inner
      light,&rdquo; was once revealed. The Schwenkfelds, Weigels, Giordano Brunos
      of the sixteenth century, who used what they called the
      &ldquo;inner light&rdquo; in somewhat the same way as the Council of Trent employed
      dogmatic tradition, had a long line of ancestry in the medi&aelig;val
      Church, and their appearance at the time of the Reformation was only
      the recrudescence of certain phases of medi&aelig;val thought. But,
      as has been said, such thinkers were never able, nor perhaps did they
      wish, to form their followers into a Church; and they belong much more
      to the history of philosophy than to an ecclesiastical narrative. They
      had no conception whatever of religion in the Reformation sense of
      the word. Their idea of faith was purely intellectual&mdash;something
      to be fed on metaphysics more or less refined.</p>
<p>By far the most numerous of those sixteenth century representatives of
      medi&aelig;val nonconformists were classed by contemporaries under
      the common name of Anabaptists or Katabaptists, because, from 1526
      onwards, they all, or most of them, insisted on <i>re-</i>baptism as
      the sign of belonging to the brotherhood of believers. They were scattered
      over the greater part of Europe, from Sweden in the north to Venice
      in the south, from England in the west to Poland in the east. The Netherlands,
      Germany,&mdash;southern, north-western, and the Rhineland,&mdash;Switzerland,
      the Tyrol, Moravia, and Livonia were scenes of bloody persecution endured
      with heroic constancy. Their leaders flit across the pages of history,
      courageous, much-enduring men, to whom the world was nothing, whose
      eyes were fixed on the eternal throne of God, and who lived in the
      calm consciousness that in a few hours they might be fastened to the
      stake or called upon to endure more dreadful and more prolonged tortures,&mdash;men
      of every varying type of character, from the gentle and pious young
      Humanist Hans
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
Denck to Jan Matthys the forerunner of the stern Camisard and Covenanter.
      No statement of doctrine can include the beliefs held in all their
      innumerable groups. Some maintained the distinctive doctrines of the
      medi&aelig;val Church (the special conceptions of a priestly hierarchy,
      and of the Sacraments being always excluded); others were Lutherans,
      Calvinists, or Zwinglians; some were Unitarians, and denied the usual
      doctrine of the Person of Christ;<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> a
      few must be classed among the Pantheists. All held some doctrine of
      an &ldquo;inner light&rdquo;; but while some sat very loose to the letter of Scripture,
      others insisted on the most literal reading and application of Biblical
      phraseology. They all united in maintaining that true Christians ought
      to live separate from the world (<i>i.e.</i> from those who were not
      rebaptized), in communities whose lives were to be modelled on the
      accounts given in the New Testament of the primitive Christians, and
      that the true Church had nothing whatever to do with the State.</p>
<p>Curiously enough, the leaders in the third group, the anti-Trinitarians,
      were almost all Italians.</p>
<p>The most outstanding man among them, distinguished alike by his learning,
      his pure moral life, a distinct vein of piety, and the calm courage
      with which he faced every danger to secure the propagation of his opinions,
      was the Spaniard Miguel Servede (Servetus),<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> who
      was burnt at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg
      425]</a></span> Geneva in 1553. He was very much a man by himself.
      His whole line of thought separated him from the rest of the anti-Trinitarian
      group associated with the names of the Sozzini. He reached his position
      through a mystical Pantheism&mdash;a course of thought which one might
      have expected from a Spaniard. He made few or no disciples, and did
      not exert any permanent influence.</p>
<p>The other anti-Trinitarians of the first rank were all cultured Italians,
      whom the spirit of the Renaissance prompted to criticise and reconstruct
      theology as they found it. They were all men who had been driven to
      reject the Roman Church because of its corruptions and immoralities,
      and who had no conception of any other universal Christian society.
      Men of pure lives, pious after their own fashion, they never had any
      idea of what lay at the root of the Reformation thought of what real
      religion was. It never dawned upon them that the sum of Christianity
      is the God of Grace, manifest in Christ, accessible to every believing
      soul, and unwavering trust on man&rsquo;s part. Their interest in religion
      was almost exclusively intellectual. The Reformers had defined the
      Church as the fellowship of believers, and they had said that the marks
      of that fellowship were the preaching of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg
      426]</a></span> the Word and the right use of the sacraments&mdash;the
      means through which God manifests Himself to men, and men manifest
      their faith in God. These men never apprehended this; the only idea
      which they seemed able to have of the Church was a school of definite
      and correct opinions. Compelled to flee from their native land, they
      naturally took refuge in Switzerland or in the Grisons. It is almost
      pathetic to see how they utterly failed to understand the men among
      whom they found themselves. Reformation to them was a criticism and
      reconstruction of theology; they were simply carrying the criticism
      a little further than their new neighbours. They never perceived the
      real gulf fixed between them and the adherents of the Reformation.</p>
<p>They were all highly educated and cultivated men&mdash;individual units
      from all parts of Italy. Camillo Renato, who proclaimed himself an
      Anabaptist, was a Sicilian. Gentili came from Calabria; Gribaldo from
      Padua; Bernardino Occhino, who in his later days joined the band, and
      the two Sozzini from Siena. Alciat was a Piedmontese. Blandrata (Biandrata),
      the most energetic member of the group save Fausto Sozzini, belonged
      to a noble family in Saluzzo which had long been noted for the protection
      it had afforded to poor people persecuted by the Church. They were
      physicians or lawyers; one, Gentili, was a schoolmaster.</p>
<p>The strong sense of individuality, which seems the birthright of every
      Italian, fostered by their life within their small city republics,
      had been accentuated by the Renaissance. The historical past of Italy,
      and its political and social condition in the sixteenth century, made
      it impossible for the impulse towards reform to take any other shape
      than that of individual action. The strength and the impetus which
      comes from the thought of fellow-man, fellow-believer, and which was
      so apparent in the Reformation movements beyond the Alps and in the
      Jesuit reaction, was entirely lacking among these Reformers in Italy.
      In that land the Empire had never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg
      427]</a></span> regained its power lost under the great Popes, Gregory <span class="smcap">VII.</span> and
      Innocent <span class="smcap">III.</span> The Romish Church presented
      itself to all Italians as the only possible form under which a wide-spreading
      Christian <i>Society</i> could be organised. If men rejected it, personal
      Christian life alone remained. The Church dominated the masses unprepared
      by any such conception of ecclesiastical reform as influenced the people
      in Germany and Switzerland. Only men who had received some literary
      education were susceptible to the influences making for Reformation.
      They were always prevented by the unbroken power of the agencies of
      the Church from organising themselves publicly into congregations,
      and could only meet to exchange confidences privately and on rare occasions.<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> We
      hear of several such assemblies, which invariably took the form of
      conferences, in which the members discussed and communicated to each
      other the criticisms of the medi&aelig;val theology which solitary
      meditation had suggested to them. They were much more like debating
      societies than the beginnings of a Church. Thus we hear of one at Vincenza,<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> in
      1546, where about forty friends met, among whom was Lelio Sozzini,
      where they debated such doctrines as the Satisfaction of Christ, the
      Trinity, etc., and expressed doubts about their truth. It was inevitable
      that such men could not hope to create a popular movement towards Reformation
      in their native land, and also that they should be compelled to seek
      safety beyond the bounds of Italy. They fled, one by one, across the
      Alps. In the Grisons and in Reformed Switzerland they found little
      communities of their countrymen who had sought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg
      428]</a></span> shelter there, and their presence was always followed
      by dissensions and by difficulties with the native Protestants.</p>
<p>Their whole habits of life and thought were not of the kind calculated
      to produce a lasting Christian fellowship. Their theological opinions,
      which were not the outcome of a new and living Christian experience,
      but had been the result of an intellectual criticism of the medi&aelig;val
      theology, had little stability, and did not tend to produce unity.
      The execution of Servede and the jealousy which all the Reformed cantons
      of Switzerland manifested towards opinions in any way similar to those
      of the learned Spaniard, made life in Switzerland as unsafe as it had
      been in Italy. They migrated to Poland and Transylvania, attracted
      by the freedom of thought existing in both lands.</p>
<p>Poland, besides, had special attractions for refugees from Italy. The
      two countries had long been in intimate relationship. Italian architects
      had designed the stately buildings in Crakau and other Polish cities,
      and the commercial intercourse between the two countries was great.
      The independence and the privileges of the Polish nobles secured them
      from ecclesiastical interference, and both Calvinism and Lutheranism
      had found many adherents among the aristocracy. They, like the Roman
      patricians of the early centuries, gave the security of their halls
      to their co-religionists, and the heads of the Romanist Church chafed
      at their impotence to prevent the spread of opinions and usages which
      they deemed heretical. In Transylvania the absence of a strong central
      government permitted the same freedom to the expression of every variety
      of religious opinion.</p>
<p>The views held by the group of anti-Trinitarians were by no means the
      same. They reproduced in Poland the same medley of views we find existing
      in the end of the third century. Some were Sabellians, others Adoptianists,
      a few were Arians. Perhaps most of them believed in the miraculous
      birth of our Lord, and held as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg
      429]</a></span> a consequence that He ought to be adored; but a strong
      minority, under the leadership of Francis Davidis, repudiated the miraculous
      birth, and refused to worship Christ (<i>non-adorantes</i>). For a
      time they seem to have lived in a certain amount of accord with the
      members of the Reformed communities. A crisis came at the Polish Diet
      of 1564, and the anti-Trinitarians were recognised then to be a separate
      religious community, or <i>ecclesia minor</i>. This was the field in
      which Fausto Sozzini exercised his commanding intellect, his genius
      for organisation, and his eminently strong will. He created out of
      these jarring elements the Socinian Church.</p>
<p>The Anabaptist and the Socinian movements require, however, a more detailed
      description.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>ANABAPTISM.<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a></h3>
<p>The old monotonous mode of describing Anabaptism has almost entirely disappeared
      with the modern careful examination of sources. It is no longer possible
      to sum up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg
      431]</a></span> movement in four stages, beginning with the Zwickau
      prophets and ending with the catastrophe in M&uuml;nster, or to explain
      its origin by calling it the radical side of the Reformation movement.<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> It
      is acknowledged by careful students to have been a very complicated
      affair, to have had roots buried in the previous centuries, and to
      have had men among its leaders who were distinguished Humanists. It
      is now known that it spread over Europe with great rapidity, and attracted
      to itself an enormously larger number of adherents than had been imagined.</p>
<p>It is impossible within the limits of one brief chapter to state and criticise
      the various theories of the origin and roots of the movement which
      modern investigation has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg
      432]</a></span> suggested. All that can be done is to set down succinctly
      the conclusions reached after a tolerably wide examination of the sources&mdash;admitting
      at the same time that more information must be obtained ere the history
      of the movement advances beyond the controversial stage.</p>
<p>It is neither safe nor easy to make abrupt general statements about the
      causes or character of great popular movements. The elements which
      combine to bring them into being and keep them in existence are commonly
      as innumerable as the hues which blend in the colour of a mountain
      side. Anabaptism was such a complicated movement that it presents peculiar
      difficulties. As has been said, it had a distinct relation to two different
      streams of medi&aelig;val life, the one social and the other religious&mdash;the
      revolts of peasants and artisans, and the successions of the <i>Brethren</i>.</p>
<p>From the third quarter of the fifteenth century social uprisings had taken
      place almost every decade, all of them more or less impregnated with
      crude religious beliefs. They were part of the intellectual and moral
      atmosphere that the &ldquo;common man,&rdquo; whether in town or country district,
      continuously breathed, and their power over him must not be lost sight
      of. The Reformation movement quickened and strengthened these influences
      simply because it set all things in motion. It is not possible, therefore,
      to draw a rigid line of separation between some sides of the Anabaptist
      movement and the social revolt; and hence it is that there is at least
      a grain of truth in the conception that the Anabaptists were the revolutionaries
      of the times of the Reformation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are good reasons for asserting that the distinctively
      religious side of Anabaptism had little to do with the anarchic outbreaks.
      It comes in direct succession from those communities of pious Christians
      who, on the testimony of their enemies, lived quiet God-fearing lives,
      and believed all the articles in the Apostles&rsquo; Creed; but who were
      strongly anti-clerical. They lived unobtrusively, and rarely appear
      in history save when the chronicle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg
      433]</a></span> of some town makes casual mention of their existence,
      or when an Inquisitor ferreted them out and records their so-called
      heresies. Their objections to the constitution and ceremonies of the
      medi&aelig;val Church were exactly those of the Anabaptists of the
      sixteenth century; and if we do not find a universal repudiation of
      infant baptism, there are traces that some did not approve of it. They
      insisted that the service ought to be in the vulgar tongue; they objected
      to all the Church festivals; to all blessing of buildings, crosses,
      and candles; they alleged that Christ did not give His Apostles stoles
      or chasubles; they scoffed at excommunications, Indulgences, and dispensations;
      they declared that there was no regenerative efficacy in infant baptism;
      and they were keenly alive to all the injunctions of Christian charity&mdash;it
      was better, they said, to clothe the poor than to expend money on costly
      vestments or to adorn the walls of Churches, and they kept up schools
      and hospitals for lepers. They met in each other&rsquo;s houses for public
      worship, which took the form of reading and commenting upon the Holy
      Scriptures.<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a></p>
<p>As we are dependent on very casual sources of information, it is not surprising
      that we cannot trace their <i>continuous</i> descent down to the period
      of the Reformation; but we do find in the earlier decades of the sixteenth
      century notices of the existence of small praying communities, which
      have all the characteristics of those recorded in the Inquisitors&rsquo;
      reports belonging to the end of the fourteenth or beginning of the
      fifteenth centuries. They appeared in Basel in 1514, in Switzerland
      in 1515, in Mainz in 1518, and in Augsburg somewhat earlier.<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> By
      the year 1524 similar &ldquo;praying circles&rdquo; were recorded as existing in
      France, in the Netherlands, in Italy, in Saxony, in Franconia, at Strassburg,
      and in Bohemia. They used a common catechism for the instruction of
      their young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg
      434]</a></span> people which was printed in French, German, Bohemian,
      and perhaps Italian. In Germany, the Bible was the German Vulgate&mdash;a
      version retained among the Anabaptists long after the publication of
      Luther&rsquo;s. They exhibited great zeal in printing and distributing the
      pious literature of the <i>Friends of God</i> of the fourteenth and
      fifteenth centuries. Many of them taught Baptist views, though the
      tenets were not universally accepted, and they were already called
      Anabaptists or Katabaptists&mdash;a term of reproach. Some of their
      more distinguished leaders were pious Humanists, and <i>their</i> influence
      may perhaps be seen in the efforts made by the <i>Brethren</i> to print
      and distribute the <i>Defensor Pacis</i> of Marsiglio of Padua.</p>
<p>This quiet Evangelical movement assumed a more definite form in 1524.
      Before that date the associations of pious people acted like the Pietists
      of the seventeenth or like the Wesleyans of the eighteenth century.
      They associated together for mutual edification; they did not obtrusively
      separate themselves from the corrupt or slothful Church. But in June
      1524, delegates representing a very wide circle of &ldquo;praying assemblies&rdquo; or <i>Readings</i> met
      at Waldshut, in the house of Balthasar H&uuml;bmaier,<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> bringing
      their Bibles with them, to consult how to organise their Christian
      living on the lines laid down in the New Testament. No regular ecclesiastical
      organisation was formed. <i>The Brethren</i> resolved to separate from
      the Papal Church; they published a Directory for Christian living,
      and drew up a statement of principles in which they believed. Amongst
      other things, they protested against any miraculous efficacy in the
      Sacraments in general, and held that Baptism is efficacious only when
      it is received in faith. This led afterwards to the adoption of Baptist
      views. A second conference was held at Augsburg in 1526, which probably
      dates the time when adult baptism became a distinctive belief among
      all the <i>Brethren</i>. This conference suggested a General Synod
      which met at Augsburg in 1527 (Aug.), and included among its members,
      delegates from Munich,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg
      435]</a></span> Franconia, Ingolstadt, Upper Austria, Styria, and Switzerland.
      There they drew up a statement of doctrinal truth, which is very simple,
      and corresponds intimately with what is now taught among the Moravian
      Brethren. Their Hymn-book<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> does
      not bear any traces of the errors in doctrine usually attributed to
      them. Its chief theme is the love of God awakening our love to God
      and to our fellow-men. Instead of infant baptism they had a ceremony
      in which the children were consecrated to God. Baptism was regarded
      as the sign of conversion and of definite resolve to give one&rsquo;s self
      up to the worship and service of God. It was administered by <i>sprinkling</i>;
      the recipient knelt to receive it in the presence of the congregation.
      The Holy Supper was administered at stated times, and always after
      one or two days of solemn preparation. Their office-bearers were deacons,
      elders, masters and teachers, or pastors. They distinguished between
      pastors who were wandering evangelists and those who were attached
      to single congregations. The latter, who were ordained by the laying
      on of hands, alone had the right to dispense the Sacraments. All the
      deacons, elders, and pastors belonging to communities within a prescribed
      district, selected from among themselves delegates who formed their
      ecclesiastical council for the district, and this council elected one
      of the pastors to act as Bishop or Superintendent. It was the Superintendent
      who ordained by laying on of hands. The whole of the <i>Brethren</i> were
      governed ecclesiastically by a series of Synods corresponding to those
      in the Presbyterian Churches. This organisation enabled the Anabaptists
      to endure the frightful persecution which they were soon to experience
      at the hands of the papal and Lutheran State Churches.</p>
<p>The chief leaders were Balthasar H&uuml;bmaier and Hans Denck. H&uuml;bmaier
      was a distinguished scholar. He became, at an unusually early age,
      Professor of theology at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg
      436]</a></span> Ingolstadt (1512); he was Rector of the famous High
      School in that city (1515); and Cathedral preacher at Regensburg (Ratisbon)
      (1516). In 1519, feeling that he could no longer conscientiously occupy
      such positions, he retired to the little town of Waldshut. Hans Denck
      was a noted Humanist, a member of the &ldquo;Erasmus circle&rdquo; at Basel, and
      esteemed the most accurate Greek scholar in the learned community.
      Conrad Grebel, another well-known Anabaptist leader, also belonged
      to the &ldquo;Erasmus circle,&rdquo;
      and was a member of one of the patrician families of Zurich. Like H&uuml;bmaier
      and Denck, he gave up all to become an evangelist, and spent his life
      on long preaching tours. These facts are sufficient to refute the common
      statement that the Anabaptists were ignorant fanatics.</p>
<p>Perhaps Denck was the most widely known and highly esteemed. In the summer
      of 1523 he was appointed Rector of the celebrated Sebaldus School in
      N&uuml;rnberg. In the end of 1524 he was charged with heresy, and along
      with him J&ouml;rg Penz, the artist, the favourite pupil of Albert
      D&uuml;rer, and four others. Denck was banished from the city, and
      his name became well known. This trial and sentence was the occasion
      of his beginning that life of wandering evangelist which had among
      other results the conferences in 1526 and 1527, and the organisation
      above described. Denck had drunk deeply at the well of the fourteenth
      and fifteenth century Mystics, and his teaching was tinged by many
      of their ideas. He believed that there was a spark of the divine nature
      in man, an Inner Word, which urged man to walk in the ways of God,
      and that man could always keep true to the inward monitor, who was
      none else than Christ. The accounts given of some of his addresses
      seem to be echoes of Tauler&rsquo;s famous sermon on the Bridegroom and the
      Bride, for he taught that the sufferings of the faithful are to be
      looked upon as the love-gifts of the Saviour, and are neither to be
      mourned nor resisted. We are told in the quaint <i>Chronicle</i> of
      Sebastian Frauck, that the Baptist current swept swiftly through the
      whole land; many thousands were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg
      437]</a></span> baptized, and many hearts drawn to them. &ldquo;For they
      taught nothing but love, faith, and crucifixion of the flesh, manifesting
      patience and humility under many sufferings, breaking bread with one
      another in sign of unity and love, helping one another with true helpfulness,
      lending, borrowing, giving, learning to have all things in common,
      calling each other &lsquo;brother.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> He
      adds that they were accused of many things of which they were innocent,
      and were treated very tyrannically.</p>
<p>The Anabaptists, like the earlier Mystics, displayed a strong individuality;
      and this makes it impossible to classify their tenets in a body of
      doctrine which can be held to express the system of intellectual belief
      which lay at the basis of the whole movement. We have three contemporary
      accounts which show the divergence of opinion among them&mdash;two
      from hostile and one from a sympathetic historian. Bullinger<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> attempts
      a classification of their different divisions, and mentions thirteen
      distinct sects within the Anabaptist circle; but they manifestly overlap
      in such a way as to suggest a very large amount of difference which
      cannot be distinctly tabulated. Sebastian Franck<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> notes
      all the varieties of views which Bullinger mentions, but refrains from
      any classification. &ldquo;There are,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;more sects and opinions,
      which I do not know and cannot describe, but it appears to me that
      there are not two to be found who agree with each other on all points.&rdquo; Kessler,<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> who
      recounts the story of the Anabaptists of St. Gallen, notes the same
      great variety of opinions.</p>
<p>It is quite possible to describe the leading ideas taught by a few noted
      men and approved of by their immediate circle of followers, and so
      to arrive with some accuracy at the popularity of certain leading principles
      among different parties, but it must be remembered that no great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg
      438]</a></span> leader imposed his opinions on the whole Anabaptist
      circle, and that the views held at different times by prominent men
      were not invariably the sentiments which lay at the basis of the whole
      movement.</p>
<p>The doctrine of passive resistance was held by almost all the earlier
      Anabaptists, but it was taught and practised in such a great variety
      of ways that a merely general statement gives a misleading idea. All
      the earlier Anabaptists believed that it was unchristian to return
      evil for evil, and that they should take the persecutions which came
      to them without attempting to retaliate. Some, like the young Humanist,
      Hans Denck, pushed the theory so far that they believed that no real
      Christian could be either a magistrate or a soldier. A small band of
      Anabaptists, to whom one of the Counts of Liechtenstein had given shelter
      at Nikolsburg, told their protector plainly that they utterly disapproved
      of his threatening the Austrian Commissary with armed resistance if
      he entered the Nikolsburg territory to seize them. In short, what is
      called &ldquo;passive resistance&rdquo; took any number of forms, from the ordinary
      Christian maxim to be patient under tribulation, to that inculcated
      and practised by the modern sect of Dunkers.</p>
<p>The followers of Melchior Hoffman, called &ldquo;Melchiorites,&rdquo;
      held apocalyptic or millenarian views, and expected in the near future
            the return of Christ to reign over His saints; but there is no
            reason to suppose that this conception was very widely adopted,
            still less that it can be called a tenet of Anabaptism in general.
            All the Anabaptists inculcated the duty of charity and the claims
            of the poor on the richer members of the community; but that
            is a common Christian precept, and does not necessarily imply
            communistic theories or practices. All that can be definitely
            said of the whole Anabaptist circle was that they did keep very
            clearly before them the obligations of Christian love. The so-called
            Communism in M&uuml;nster will be described later.</p>
<p>When we examine carefully the incidental records of contemporary witnesses
      observing their Anabaptist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg
      439]</a></span> neighbours, we reach the general conclusion that their
      main thought was to reproduce in their own lives what seemed to them
      to be the beliefs, usages, and social practices of the primitive Christians.
      Translations of the Bible and of parts of it had been common enough
      in Germany before Luther&rsquo;s days. The &ldquo;common man,&rdquo;
      especially the artisan of the towns, knew a great deal about the Bible.
      It was the one book he read, re-read, and pondered over. Fired with
      the thoughts created in his mind by its perusal, simple men felt impelled
      to become itinerant preachers. The &ldquo;call&rdquo; came to them, and they responded
      at once to what they believed to be the divine voice. Witness Hans
      Ber of Alten-Erlangen, a poor peasant. He rose from his bed one night
      and suddenly began to put on his clothes. &ldquo;Whither goest thou?&rdquo;
      asked his poor wife. &ldquo;I know not; God knoweth,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;What
      evil have I done thee? Stay and help me to bring up my little children,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dear
      wife,&rdquo;
      he answered, &ldquo;trouble me not with the things of time. I must away,
      that I may learn the will of the Lord.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> Such
      men wandered about in rude homespun garments, often barefooted, their
      heads covered with rough felt hats. They craved hospitality in houses,
      and after supper produced their portions of the Bible, read and expounded,
      then vanished in the early morning. We are told how Hans Hut came to
      the house of Franz Strigel at Weier in Franconia, produced his Bible,
      read and expounded, explained the necessity of adult baptism, convinced
      Strigel, the house father, and eight others, and baptized them there
      and then. He wandered forth the same night. None of the baptized saw
      him again; but the little community remained&mdash;a small band of
      Anabaptists.<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a></p>
<p>These wandering preachers, &ldquo;prophets&rdquo; they may be called if we give them
      the early Christian name, were not drilled in any common set of opinions.
      Each conceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg
      440]</a></span> the primitive teaching and social life as he seemed
      to see it reflected in the New Testament; and no two conceptions were
      exactly the same. The circumstances and surroundings produced an infinite
      variety of thought about the doctrines and usages which ought to be
      accepted and practised. Yet they had traditional modes of interpretation
      handed down to them from the praying circles of the &ldquo;Brethren.&rdquo;
      Compare what the Austrian Inquisitor says of the
      &ldquo;Brethren&rdquo; in the thirteenth century, with what Johann Kessler tells
      about the Anabaptists of St. Gallen, and the resemblance is striking
      so far as external appearance goes. &ldquo;H&aelig;retici cognoscuntur per
      mores et verba,&rdquo; says the Inquisitor. &ldquo;Sunt enim in moribus compositi

      tells us that the walk and conversation of these Anabaptists was &ldquo;throughout
      pious, holy, and blameless&rdquo;; that they refrained from wearing costly
      apparel, despised luxurious eating and drinking, clothed themselves
      in rough cloth, wore slouch hats on their heads. Franck relates that
      they refused to frequent wine-shops and the &ldquo;gild&rdquo; rooms where dances
      were held.</p>
<p>As they lived again the life of these medi&aelig;val sectaries, so they
      reproduced their opinions in the same sporadic way. Some of them objected
      to all war even in self-defence, as did some of the earlier Lollards.
      Their Lord had said to His first disciples: &ldquo;Go your ways: behold,
      I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves.&rdquo; They flung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg
      441]</a></span> from them the sword, with which peasant and artisan
      were then alike girt, and went about as the apostles were ordered to
      do, with staves in their hands&mdash;the <i>St&auml;bler</i> or <i>staffmen</i> who
      would have nothing to do with the weapons of wolves. Others, also like
      some of the Lollards, would not enter the
      &ldquo;huge stone houses with great glass windows which men called &lsquo;churches.&rsquo;&rdquo; The
      early Christians had preached and &ldquo;broken bread&rdquo; in houses; and they
      would follow their example; and in private rooms, in the streets, in
      the market-places, they proclaimed their gospel of peace and contentment.
      The infinitesimal number who taught something like &ldquo;free love,&rdquo; and
      who were repudiated by the others, were reproducing the vagaries of
      the medi&aelig;val <i>Brethren and Sisters of the Free Spirit</i>,
      who gave Meister Eckhart so much trouble centuries before in the Rhineland.
      All the more extravagant ideas and practices which appear among small
      sections of these Anabaptists of the sixteenth century can be found
      among the sectaries of the Middle Ages. For the whole Anabaptist movement
      was medi&aelig;val to the core; and, like most of the medi&aelig;val
      religious awakenings, produced an infinite variety of opinions and
      practices. The one idea common to all was, that the Christians of the
      sixteenth century were called to reproduce in thought and life the
      intellectual beliefs and usages of the primitive Christians. It is
      simply impossible to give any account of opinions and practices which
      were <i>universally</i> prevalent among them. Even the most widely
      spread usages, adult baptism and the &ldquo;breaking of bread,&rdquo; were not
      adopted in all the divisions of the Anabaptists.</p>
<p>What is more, they were modern enough, at least in the earlier stages
      of the movement, to be conscious of this (which the Mystics were not),
      and to give it expression. All felt and thought as did a &ldquo;simple man,&rdquo; Hans
      M&uuml;ller of Medikon, when brought before the Zurich magistrates:
      &ldquo;Do not lay a burden on my conscience, for faith is a gift given freely
      by God, and is not common property. The mystery of God lies hidden,
      like the treasure in the field, which no one can find but he to whom
      the Spirit shows it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg
      442]</a></span> So I beg you, ye servants of God, let my faith stand
      free.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> And
      the Anabaptists, alone of all the religious parties in those strenuous
      times, seem to have recognised that what they claimed for themselves
      they were bound to grant to others. Great differences in opinion did
      not prevent the strictest brotherly fellowship. Hans Denck held a doctrine
      of non-resistance as thoroughgoing as that of Count Tolstoy, and fully
      recognised the practical consequences to which it led. But this did
      not prevent the ardent and gifted young Humanist working loyally with
      H&uuml;bmaier, who did not share his extreme opinions. The divergences
      among the leaders appeared in their followers without destroying the
      sense of brotherhood. Franck tells us in his <i>Chronicle</i><a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> that
      some, but very few, held that no Christian could enter the magistracy,
      for Christians had nothing to do with the sword, but only with spiritual
      excommunication, and that no Christian should fight and slay. The others,
      he says, including the very great majority, believed that Christians
      might become magistrates, and that in case of dire necessity and when
      they clearly saw the leading of God, might take their share in fighting
      as soldiers.</p>
<p>Melchior Hoffman, while he believed in the incarnation, held that Jesus
      received His flesh directly from God, and did not owe His body to the
      Virgin Mother, through whom He passed &ldquo;as light through a pane of glass.&rdquo;
      He also held that the whole history of the world, down to the last
      days, was revealed in Scripture, and could be discovered through prayer
      and meditation. He was an eloquent and persuasive preacher, and his
      views were accepted by many; but it would be a great mistake to assume
      that they were shared in by the Anabaptists as a community. Yet even
      contemporaries, who were opponents, usually attribute the extreme opinions
      of a few to the entire body.</p>
<p>It ought to be observed that this tolerance of different opinions within
      the one society did not extend to those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg
      443]</a></span> who remained true to the State Churches, whether Romanist
      or Reformed. The Anabaptists would have nothing to do with a State
      Church; and this was the main point in their separation from the Lutherans,
      Zwinglians, and Calvinists. It was perhaps the <i>one</i> conception
      on which all parties among them were in absolute accord. The real Church,
      which might be small or great, was for them an association of believing
      people; and the great ecclesiastical institutions into which unconscious
      infants were admitted by a ceremony called baptism long before they
      could have or exercise faith, represented to them an idea subversive
      of true Christianity. They had no wish to persecute men who differed
      widely from them, but they would not associate with them. This enforced &ldquo;separation,&rdquo; like
      everything else connected with Anabaptism, differed considerably in
      the way in which it was carried into practice. In some of the smaller
      sections it appeared in very extravagant forms. Wives and husbands,
      Anabaptists whose partners belonged to the State Churches, were in
      some small sections advised to refuse cohabitation. It is more than
      probable that some recorded sayings on which opponents have founded
      charges of encouraging sexual irregularities,&mdash;that it was better
      for women to have connection irregularly with members of the brotherhood
      than to cohabit with unbelieving husbands,&mdash;were simply extravagant
      ways of expressing this duty of separation.</p>
<p>It is also true that as time went on and sects of extreme opinions multiplied,
      the excommunication of members for their views came to be a common
      practice. It was as frequent among some of the smaller divisions as
      it is among modern Plymouth Brethren; but the occasion was, as a rule,
      difference of opinion about the way to express and exercise the duty
      of not returning evil for evil&mdash;was it permitted to pay taxes
      or not? was it lawful to see without protest their protectors using
      force to prevent their enemies from attacking them, etc.?</p>
<p>The earlier ideas of non-resistance, whatever practical shape they might
      take, gave way before the continuous and terrible persecution which
      the Anabaptists had to endure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg
      444]</a></span> They were first definitely condemned by Melchior Hoffman
      and his followers. They believed in the speedy establishment on earth
      of the millennial kingdom of Christ, and they declared that they were
      ready to fight for it when it appeared. With them the conception was
      simply a pious opinion, and they had no occasion to reduce it to action.
      The Anabaptists, however, who followed the teaching of Jan Matthys
      and of his disciple Jan Bockelson, repudiated passive resistance both
      in theory and in practice.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many things about some, perhaps all, great religious
      awakenings which critics can lay hold of to their disparagement; and
      it was so with the Anabaptist movement. Everything, from the scientific
      frame of mind to the religious sensibility, has the defects of its
      qualities. When a man is seized and possessed by a new spiritual emotion
      which seems to lift him above all previous experience of life or of
      thought, all things are new to him, and all things seem possible. His
      old life with its limitations has departed. He is embarked on a sea
      which has no imprisoning shores. He is carried along on a great current
      of emotion, and others are borne with him. Human deep calleth unto
      deep when they exchange confidences. He and his fellows have become
      new creatures; and that is almost all that they know about themselves.
      Such experiences are quite consistent with soundness of mind and clearness
      of vision of God and Divine things&mdash;that is usual; but sometimes
      they are too powerful for the imperfect mind which holds them. The
      converts are
      &ldquo;puffed up,&rdquo; as St. Paul said. Then arise morbid states, distorted
      vision, sometimes actual shipwreck of mental faculties, not seldom
      acute religious mania. Leaders in a great religious awakening have
      always to reckon with such developments&mdash;St. Paul, Francis of
      Assisi, Eckhart, Tauler, to say nothing of modern instances. The Apostle
      addressed morbid souls with severe sarcasm. Did any man really think,
      he asked, that to commit incest, to take to wife his father&rsquo;s widow,
      was an example of the freedom with which Christ had made them free?</p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></p>
<p>The Anabaptist movement had its share of such cases, like other religious
      movements; they grew more frequent as the unfortunate people were maddened
      by persecution; and these exceptional incidents are invariably retailed
      at length by historians hostile to the movement.</p>
<p>The Anabaptists, as a whole, were subjected to persecutions, especially
      from the Romanists and the Lutherans, much more harsh than befell any
      of the religious parties of the sixteenth century. Their treatment
      in Zurich may be taken as an example of how they came in contact with
      the civil authorities, and how their treatment grew in severity.<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a></p>
<p>The Swiss Anabaptists were in no sense disciples of Zwingli. They had
      held their distinctive principles and were a recognised community long
      before Zwingli came from Einsiedeln, and were the lineal descendants
      of the medi&aelig;val Waldenses. They welcomed the Reformer; some of
      them were in the company who challenged the authorities by eating meat
      during Lent in 1522; but a fundamental difference soon emerged. After
      the Public Disputation of 1523, when it became clear that Zurich meant
      to accept the Reformation, a deputation of the <i>Brethren</i> appeared
      before the Council to urge their idea of what a Reformed Church should
      be. Their statement of principles is an exposition of the fundamental
      conceptions which lay at the basis of the whole Anabaptist movement,
      and explains why they could not join either the Lutheran or the Reformed
      branch of the Reformation Church. They insisted that an Evangelical
      Church must differ from the Roman Church in this among other things,
      that it should consist of members who had made a personal profession
      of faith in their Saviour, and who had vowed to live in obedience to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg
      446]</a></span> Jesus Christ their <i>Hauptmann</i>. It could not be
      like a State Church, whether Romanist or other, to which people belonged
      without any individual profession of faith. They insisted that the
      Church, thus formed, should be free from all civil control, to decide
      for itself what doctrines and ceremonies of worship were founded on
      the Word of God, and agreeable thereto, and should make this decision
      according to the opinions of a majority of the members. They further
      asked that the Church should be free to exercise, by brotherly admonition
      and, as a last resort, by excommunication, discipline on such of its
      members as offended against the moral law. They also declared that
      the Church which thus rejected State control ought to refuse State
      support, and proposed that the tithes should be secularised. The New
      Testament, they said, knew nothing about interest and usury, tithes,
      livings, and prebends.</p>
<p>These views were quite opposed to the ideas of the Zurich Council, who
      contemplated a State Church reformed from Romanist abuses, but strictly
      under the control of the State, and supported by the tithes, as the
      medi&aelig;val Church had been. They refused to adopt the ideas of
      the Anabaptists; and this was the beginning of the antagonism. The
      Council found that the great majority of the petitioners had doubts
      about infant baptism, and were inclined to what are now called Baptist
      views; and they brought matters to a crisis by ordering a Public Disputation
      on Baptism (Jan. 17th, 1525). Among the Anabaptists who appeared to
      defend their principles, were young Conrad Grebel the Humanist, Felix
      Manz, and Brother J&ouml;rg from Jacob&rsquo;s House, a conventual establishment
      near Chur, who is always called &ldquo;Blaurock&rdquo; (Blue-coat). They were opposed
      by Zwingli, who insisted that infant baptism must be maintained, because
      it took the place of circumcision. The Council decided that Zwingli&rsquo;s
      contention was right, and they made it a <i>law</i> that <i>all children
      must be baptized</i>, and added that all persons who refused to have
      their children baptized after Feb. 1st, 1525, were to be arrested.
      The Anabaptists were not slow to answer the challenge thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg
      447]</a></span> given. They met, and after deliberation and prayer
      Blaurock asked Conrad Grebel to baptize him in a truly Christian fashion, &ldquo;there
      being no ordained person present,&rdquo; and Grebel did so. &ldquo;When this had
      been done the others entreated Blaurock to baptize them, which he did;
      and in deep fear of the Lord they gave themselves to God.&rdquo; They resolved
      to preach and baptize, because in this they ought to obey God rather
      than men.<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a></p>
<p>When the Council heard that adult baptism had begun, they enacted that
      all who had been rebaptized after Feb. 8th (1525) were to be fined
      a silver mark, and that whoever was baptized after the issue of their
      decree should be banished. They also imprisoned the leaders. When they
      found that neither fines, nor threats, nor imprisonment, nor banishment
      had any effect on the Anabaptists, the Town Council thought to terrify
      them by a death sentence. Two were selected, Manz and Blaurock. The
      latter was not a citizen, and the sentence of death was commuted to
      one of public scourging and being thrust out of the town; but Felix
      Manz, a townsman, was put to death by drowning (1527). Zwingli insisted
      that this judicial murder was not done because of baptism, but because
      of rebellion!</p>
<p>What was done in Reformed Switzerland was seen all over Roman Catholic
      and Lutheran Germany. It is only fair to say that the persecution was
      more murderous within the Romanist districts; but the only Lutheran
      Prince who refused to permit a death penalty on Anabaptism was Philip
      of Hesse. He was afterwards joined by the Elector of Saxony.</p>
<p>In 1527 (Aug. 26th), the Archduke Ferdinand of Austria published an imperial
      mandate threatening all Anabaptists with the punishment of death. Two
      months later, two thousand copies of this proclamation were sent to
      the provinces of the German Empire, calling on the authorities to extirpate
      these unfortunate people. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg
      448]</a></span> rulers in Salzburg and in the Tyrol obeyed the order
      at once, and a fierce persecution soon raged. The minds of the population
      were inflamed by infamous calumnies. It was said in Salzburg that the
      Anabaptists had planned to massacre all the priests and monks within
      the principality. The well-known dislike of the brethren to war was
      tortured into the accusation that on a Turkish invasion they would
      side with the enemy against all loyal Germans. A certain Leopold Dickius,
      who wrote an atrocious book against the Anabaptists, demanded that
      all the men should be slain and the women and children suffered to
      perish from starvation; in this way only, he said, could their errors
      be stamped out.</p>
<p>The Salzburg chronicler, Kilian Leib, a Romanist, gives details of the
      persecution. He tells us that men, women, and young maidens suffered
      death by fire, beheading, and drowning, not only uncomplainingly, but
      with solemn joy. He dwells on the case of &ldquo;a beautiful young girl&rdquo;
      of sixteen, whose gentle innocence excited universal compassion, and
      who utterly refused to recant. The executioner pinned her hands to
      her sides, plunged her head downwards into a horse trough, held her
      there till she was suffocated, and then took her body away to burn
      it. The official lists show that the victims came from all classes
      in society. Noblemen, girdle-makers, wallet-makers, shoemakers, a town
      clerk, and ex-priests.</p>
<p>The persecution in the Tyrol was severe and thorough. A large number of
      the miners of the district were Anabaptists, and it was resolved to
      root out the so-called heresy. Descriptions were published of prominent
      Anabaptists, who wandered from place to place encouraging their brethren
      to steadfastness. &ldquo;One named Mayerhofer has a long brown beard and
      wears a grey soldier&rsquo;s coat; a companion, tall and pale, wears a long
      black coat with trimming; a third is shorter; a fourth, thin and of
      a ruddy complexion, is known as a cutler.&rdquo;
      Conrad Braun, an assessor to the imperial Chamber and an eye-witness
      to the persecutions, wrote,&mdash;&ldquo;I have seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg
      449]</a></span> with my own eyes that nothing has been able to bring
      back the Anabaptists from their errors or to make them recant. The
      hardest imprisonment, hunger, fire, water, the sword, all sorts of
      frightful executions, have not been able to shake them. I have seen
      young people, men, women, go to the stake singing, filled with joy;
      and I can say that in the course of my whole life nothing has moved
      me more.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> In
      the Tyrol and G&ouml;rz the number of executions by the year 1531 amounted
      to a thousand, according to the chronicler Kirchmayr. Sebastian Franck
      reckons the number in Enisheim, within the government of Upper Austria,
      at six hundred. Seventy-three martyrs suffered in Linz within six weeks.
      The persecution in Bavaria was particularly severe; Duke William ordered
      that those who recanted were to be beheaded, and those who refused
      were to be burned. The general practice, made a law by Ferdinand of
      Austria in 1529 (April 23rd), was that only preachers, baptizers, Baptists
      who refused to recant, and those who had relapsed after recantation,
      were to be punished with death.<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a></p>
<p>In these bloody persecutions, which raged over almost all Europe, most
      of the earlier leaders of the Anabaptists perished; but the great body
      of their followers were neither intimidated nor disposed to abjure
      their teaching. Persecution did not come unexpectedly. No one was admitted
      into an Anabaptist community without being warned of the probable fate
      which lay before him. Baptism was a vow that he would be constant unto
      death; the &ldquo;breaking of bread&rdquo; strengthened his faith; the sermon was
      full of exhortations to endurance unto the end. Their whole service
      of worship was a preparation for and an expectation of martyrdom.</p>
<p>The strain of Christian song seemed to rise higher with the fires of persecution.
      Most of the Anabaptist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg
      450]</a></span> hymns belong to the time when their sufferings were
      greatest. Some are simply histories of a martyrdom, as of J&ouml;rg
      Wagner at Munich, or of the &ldquo;Seven Brethren at Germ&uuml;nd.&rdquo; They
      are all echoes of endurance where the notes of the sob, the trust,
      the warning, the hosanna of a time of martyrdom, blend in rough heroic
      strains. They sing of Christ, who in these last days has manifested
      Himself that the pure word of His Gospel may again run through the
      earth as it did in the days of the early Church. They tell how the
      arch-enemy of souls seeks to protect himself against the advancing
      host of Jesus by exciting bloody persecutions. They utter warnings
      against false prophets, ravening wolves in sheep&rsquo;s clothing, who beset
      all the paths of life leading towards the true fold, who pour forth
      threats and curses against the people of God, and urge on the rulers
      of this world to torture and to slay. They depict how the evil world
      storms against the true Church, shrieks out lies against the true followers
      of Jesus, and threatens them with burnings and all manner of cruel
      deaths. They mourn that the disciples of Jesus are slaughtered like
      sheep who have lost their shepherd; that they wander in wildernesses
      full of thorns that tear; that they have their homes like the night-birds
      among the cliffs or in the clefts of the rocks; that they are snared
      in the nets of the fowler; that they are hunted with hounds like the
      hares. Others, inspired by the internal hope which lives undying in
      every Christian heart, tell how Christ the Bridegroom seeks the love
      of the soul His bride, and how He wins her to Himself by His love-gifts
      of trial and of suffering, till at last the marriage feast is held,
      and the soul becomes wholly united to her Lord. The thoughts and phrases
      of the old Hebrew prophets, of the Psalmist, of the hymns of the Apocalypse,
      which have fed the fears and the hopes of longing, suffering, trusting
      generations of Christian people, reappear in those Anabaptist hymns.
      Life is for them a continuous Holy War, a Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress through
      an evil world full of snares, of dangers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg
      451]</a></span> of temptations, until at last the weary feet tread
      the Delectable Mountains, the River of Death is passed, and the open
      gates of the heavenly Jerusalem receive the wayfarer who has persevered
      to the end.</p>
<p>These poor persecuted people naturally sought for some city of refuge, <i>i.e.</i> a
      municipality or district where baptism of children was not enforced
      under penalties, and where the rebaptism of adults was not punished
      by imprisonment, torture, and death. For a time they found many such
      asylums. The Anabaptists were for the most part good workmen, and patient
      and provident cultivators of the soil, ready to pay all dues but the
      unscriptural war-tax. They were a source of wealth to many a great
      landed proprietor who was willing to allow them to live their lives
      in peace. Moravia, East Friesland, and, among the municipalities, Augsburg,
      Worms, and Strassburg gave shelter until the slow determined pressure
      of the higher authorities of the Empire compelled them to act otherwise.
      All that the Anabaptists desired was to be allowed to live in peace,
      and we hear of no great disturbances caused by their presence in any
      of these &ldquo;cities of refuge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This brings us to what has been called &ldquo;The Kingdom of God in M&uuml;nster,&rdquo; and
      to the behaviour of the Anabaptists there&mdash;the communism, polygamy,
      and so forth, which are described in all histories of the times.</p>
<p>M&uuml;nster was the capital of the large and important ecclesiastical
      principality which bears the same name. The bishop was a Prince of
      the German Empire, and ruled his principality with all the rights of
      a secular prince. Clergy filled almost all the important posts of government;
      they levied taxes on imports and exports; the rich canonries of the
      cathedral were reserved for the sons of the landed gentry; the townspeople
      had no share in the richer benefices, and chafed under their clerical
      rulers. The citizens lived in a state of almost permanent disaffection,
      and their discontent had frequently taken the form of civic insurrections.
      They rose in 1525, in 1527<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg
      452]</a></span> (in which year the name of a wealthy burgher, Bernardin
      Knipperdolling, first appears as a leader of his fellow-citizens),
      and in 1529, the dreadful year of famine and plague.<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> Many
      have been disposed to see in these <i>emeutes</i>, anticipations of
      the struggle which followed; but nothing in the sources warrants the
      conclusion. They were simply examples of the discontent of the unprivileged
      classes which had been common enough in Germany for at least a century.</p>
<p>The city of M&uuml;nster had been slow to receive the religious Reformation,
      but in 1529 the people began to listen to the preaching of an obscure
      young chaplain attached to the Church of St. Maurice, built outside
      the walls of the town.<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> Bernhard
      Rothmann was a scholar, imbued with Humanist culture, gifted with the
      power of clear reasoning, and with natural eloquence. It is probable
      that he had early been attracted by the teaching of Luther;<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> but
      while he dwelt upon justification by faith, his sermons were full of
      that sympathy for the down-trodden toiling masses of the community
      which was a permanent note in all Anabaptist teaching. His sermons
      were greatly appreciated by the townsfolk, especially by the artisans,
      who streamed out of the gate to hear the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg
      453]</a></span> young chaplain of St. Maurice. Was he not one of themselves,
      the son of a poor smith! The cathedral Canons, who, in the absence
      of the Bishop, had the oversight of all ecclesiastical affairs, grew
      alarmed at his popularity. Their opportunity for interference came
      when the mob, excited, they said, by Rothmann&rsquo;s denunciations of relic
      and image worship, profaned the altars, tore the pictures, and destroyed
      the decorations in St. Maurice on the eve of Good Friday, 1531. Rothmann&rsquo;s
      influence with the townsmen might have enabled him to defy the Canons,
      especially as the Prince Bishop, Friedrich von Wied, showed no inclination
      to molest the chaplain, and was himself suspected of Evangelical sympathies.
      But he quietly left the town and spent a year in travelling. He visited
      Wittenberg, where he made the acquaintance of Luther, Melanchthon,
      and Bugenhagen; went to Marburg, Speyer, and Strassburg. At Strassburg
      he had long intercourse with Capito and with Schwenkfeld the Mystic,
      who is frequently classed with the Anabaptists. An irresistible impulse
      seems to have drawn him back to M&uuml;nster, where he was welcomed
      by the people, and the church of St. Maurice became henceforth the
      centre of a movement for religious Reformation; the preacher was supported
      by the &ldquo;gilds&rdquo; of artisans and by most of the citizens, among whom
      the most noted was Bernhard Knipperdolling.</p>
<p>An energetic protest by the Canons induced the Bishop to inhibit Rothmann
      from preaching in St. Maurice. He continued his addresses in the churchyard
      of St. Lambert (Feb. 18th, 1532), and a few days later he was placed
      in possession of the church itself. St. Lambert&rsquo;s had been built by
      the municipality, and was the property of the town. Rothmann was appointed
      by the Town Council Evangelical preacher to the town, and was given
      one of the town&rsquo;s &ldquo;gild&rdquo; houses for a parsonage.</p>
<p>Two months later the Bishop resigned, and was succeeded by Duke Erich
      of Brunswick-Grubenhagen, already Bishop of Osnabr&uuml;ck and Paderborn.
      The new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span> Bishop
      determined to get rid of Rothmann. He made representations to Hesse
      and Electoral Saxony and other Evangelical Powers, and persuaded them
      to induce the more moderate of the reforming party in M&uuml;nster
      to abandon Rothmann; and, this done, the preacher was ordered to leave
      the city. The &ldquo;gilds&rdquo; of artisans refused to let their preacher depart,
      and, under the leadership of Knipperdolling,<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> drafted
      a letter to the authorities declaring their determination to retain
      him at all hazards. The democracy of M&uuml;nster and the religious
      movement for the first time openly combined against the authorities
      of the city.</p>
<p>While things were at this pass, the Bishop died (May 13th, 1532). The
      Chapter elected (June 1st) Count Franz von Waldeck, already in possession
      of Minden, and made Bishop of Osnabr&uuml;ck a few days later (June
      11th)&mdash;a pluralist of the first rank. The reforming party in M&uuml;nster
      expected the worst from their new ruler. A full assembly of the &ldquo;gilds&rdquo; of
      the town was held, and by an overwhelming majority the members pledged
      themselves to defend their pastor and his Gospel with body and goods
      while life lasted. A committee of thirty-six burghers was elected to
      watch the course of events and to take counsel with the civic rulers
      and the presidents of the &ldquo;gilds.&rdquo; Rothmann published <i>theses</i> explaining
      his teaching, and challenging objectors to a public disputation. Public
      meetings were held; the Town Council was formally requested to hand
      over all the parochial churches to Evangelical preachers; which was
      done&mdash;the Cathedral alone remaining for Roman Catholic worship.</p>
<p>These proceedings produced unavailing remonstrances from the Bishop. The
      nobles in the neighbourhood tried to interfere, but to no purpose.
      In October (1532) the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg
      455]</a></span> Bishop&rsquo;s party within the town began to take action.
      They attempted to sequester the goods of the more prominent disaffected
      citizens; chains were placed across the principal streets to prevent
      communication between the different quarters; an attempt was made to
      isolate the town itself. These things meant war. The
      &ldquo;gilds,&rdquo; always a military organisation in medi&aelig;val cities, armed.
      A party of knights sent to invade the town retired before the armed
      citizens. While the Bishop sought to strengthen himself by alliances
      and to beguile the townsmen by negotiation, a thousand armed burghers
      marched by night to the little township of Telgte, where a large number
      of the ecclesiastical and secular nobles were encamped, surrounded
      it, captured the Bishop&rsquo;s partisans, and returned to hold them as hostages.
      This act afforded the occasion for the intervention of Philip of Hesse.
      An arrangement was come to by which M&uuml;nster was declared to be
      an Evangelical city and enrolled within the Schmalkald League. The
      history of M&uuml;nster up to this time (Feb. 14th, 1533) did not differ
      from that of many towns which had adopted the Reformation. Rothmann
      had been the leader in M&uuml;nster, like Brenz in Hall, Alber in Reutlingen,
      or Lachmann at Heilbron.</p>
<p>It is usually assumed that up to this time Rothmann was a Lutheran in
      his teaching, that he had won M&uuml;nster for the great Lutheran party,
      and that his future aberrations from the Evangelical theology were
      due to his weakness before the Anabaptist mob who later invaded the
      city. This seems to be a mere assumption. He had certainly taught justification
      by faith; but that did not make him a Lutheran. The dividing line between
      the various classes of objectors to the Roman Catholic theology in
      the sixteenth century was drawn at the meaning of the Sacraments, and
      especially of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper. There is absolutely no evidence to
      show that Rothmann was ever a follower of Luther in his theory of the
      Holy Supper. He had visited Luther and Melanchthon during his year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg
      456]</a></span> of absence from M&uuml;nster, but they had never been
      quite sure of him. He has confessed that it was at Strassburg and not
      at Wittenberg that he got most help for his future work and received
      it from Capito, who was no Lutheran, and from Schwenkfeld, who was
      an Anabaptist Mystic. It was Strassburg and not Wittenberg that he
      called &ldquo;the crown of all Christian cities and Churches!&rdquo;
      In his confession of faith he says that the Mass is no sacrifice, but
      only a sign of the true Sacrifice; and that the Mass and the Lord&rsquo;s
      Supper have <i>no other meaning</i> than to remind us of the death
      of Christ, and to awaken in our hearts a certainty of the freely given
      grace of God. That is not Lutheran doctrine, it is not even Zwinglian;
      it is much nearer the Anabaptist. It is also pretty clear that he held
      the doctrine of the &ldquo;inner light&rdquo;
      in the sense of many Anabaptists. It may be safely said that if Rothmann
      was not an Anabaptist from the beginning, his was a mind prepared to
      accept their doctrines almost as soon as they were clearly presented
      to him. Heinrich Roll, a fugitive from J&uuml;lich who sought refuge
      in M&uuml;nster, convinced Rothmann of the unlawfulness of infant baptism.
      No sooner had this conviction laid hold on him than he refused to baptize
      infants&mdash;for Rothmann was always straightforward. His views annoyed
      a large number of the leading citizens, prominent among whom was Van
      der Wieck, the syndic of the town. These men, all Lutherans, besieged
      their pastor with remonstrances, and finally brought him before the
      Town Council. The matter came to a head on Sept. 7th (1533), when Staprade,
      the assistant preacher at St. Lambert&rsquo;s, refused to baptize the children
      of two Lutheran members of the Town Council who had been brought to
      the church for the purpose. When the preachers were brought before
      the Council, they were informed that such things would not be allowed.
      Staprade, the chief offender and a non-burgher, was banished, and Rothmann
      with the other clergy who agreed with him were threatened with the
      same fate if they persisted in declining to baptize infants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg
      457]</a></span> They refused to obey the Council; they were promptly
      deposed, and their churches were closed against them. But the mass
      of the citizens were attached to Rothmann, and their attitude became
      too threatening for the Magistrates to maintain their uncompromising
      position. Rothmann was permitted to remain, and was allowed to preach
      in the Church of St. Servatius. The Lutheran Magistrates brought preachers
      into the town to occupy the other places of worship.</p>
<p>The Magistrates, Van der Wieck being the leading spirit among them, resolved
      to hold a public disputation on the subject of Baptism. They had brought
      to M&uuml;nster the famous Humanist, Hermann von dem Busche, now a
      professor in Marburg and a distinguished defender of the Lutheran Reformation,
      and they counted on his known learning and eloquence to convince their
      fellow-citizens that the views of Rothmann were unscriptural. The conference
      was to be perfectly free. Roman Catholic theologians were invited,
      and took part. Rothmann appeared to defend his position. The invitations
      had been signed not only by the Magistrates, but by the heads of the &ldquo;gilds&rdquo; of
      the town.<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> Van
      der Wieck confessed that the result of the disputation was not what
      he expected. So far as the great mass of the people were concerned,
      Rothmann appeared to have the best of the argument, and he stood higher
      than ever in the estimation of the citizens. Rothmann, whose whole
      career shows that opposition made him more and more advanced, now began
      to dwell upon the wrongs of the commonalty and the duty of the rich
      to do much more for their poorer brethren than they did. He taught
      by precept as well as example. He lived an openly ascetic life, that
      he might abound in charity. His sermons and his life had an extraordinary
      effect on the rich as well as on the poor. Creditors forgave debtors,
      men placed sums of money in the hands of Rothmann for distribution.
      There was no enforced communism, but the example of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg
      458]</a></span> primitive Church in Jerusalem was followed as far as
      possible. Among these thoroughgoing followers of Rothmann, a wealthy
      lady, the mother-in-law of Bernardin Knipperdolling, was conspicuous.</p>
<p>The Magistrates became seriously alarmed at the condition of things. They
      knew that so long as they remained a Lutheran municipality, even nominally,
      the great Lutheran Princes, like Philip of Hesse and the Elector of
      Saxony, would protect them against their Romanist Bishop; but Lutherans
      and Romanists alike disliked and distrusted Anabaptists, and the imperial
      edict would surely be enforced against them sooner or later. Rothmann&rsquo;s
      preaching, which they could not control, and the power he exercised
      through the &ldquo;gilds,&rdquo; made it impossible for them to maintain that M&uuml;nster
      was a member of the confederacy of Lutheran cities. On the other hand,
      the news that M&uuml;nster had practically become Anabaptist, spread
      far and wide among these persecuted people, who began to think that
      it was destined to be a conspicuous city of refuge, perhaps the Zion
      or New Jerusalem whose establishment Melchior Hoffman had predicted.
      They gathered from all parts to place themselves under the protection
      of its walls. The great majority naturally came from the Netherlands,
      where the persecution was hottest. The refugees were almost all <i>Melchiorites</i>&mdash;men
      who looked for a speedy termination of their sufferings in the establishment
      of the kingdom of God upon the earth; and the majority of them were
      Dutch <i>Melchiorites</i>, men to whom freedom was a tradition, ready
      to fight for it, disciples of Jan Matthys, who had taught them to abandon
      the doctrine of passive resistance so universally held by all sections
      of the earlier Anabaptists.<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> Rothmann
      had long been acquainted with the books and tracts of Hoffman, and
      had great sympathy with them. He as well as the Magistrates foresaw
      trouble for himself and for the city. He went the length of advising
      friends who did not share his opinions to leave the town; for himself,
      his manifest duty appeared to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg
      459]</a></span> to risk all on behalf of the poor people whom God had
      given into his hand.</p>
<p>The last months of 1532 saw Rothmann and the Lutheran Town Council facing
      each other with growing mutual suspicion. On Dec. 8th, a journeyman
      smith, Johann Schr&ouml;der, began preaching Anabaptist doctrines in
      the churchyard of St. Lambert&rsquo;s, and challenged the Lutheran pastor,
      Fabricius, to a disputation. This was more than the Town Council could
      endure. They prohibited Rothmann preaching, and declared that they
      withdrew their protection&mdash;a sentence of virtual outlawry (Dec.
      11th). He calmly told the messenger of the Council that he depended
      on the help of higher powers than his masters, and preached publicly
      in the Church of St. Servatius. Schr&ouml;der had begun to preach again,
      and was apprehended. The &ldquo;gild&rdquo; of the smiths rose, and, headed by
      their officials, forced the Council to release their comrade. The Anabaptists
      and Rothmann had won a notable triumph, which was soon widely known.
      Banished Anabaptist pastors returned to the town.</p>
<p>Events marched quickly thereafter. Bartholomaeus Boekbinder and Willem
      de Kuiper, sent by Jan Matthys, appeared in M&uuml;nster (Jan. 5th,
      1533). We can infer what their message was from what followed. Rothmann
      denounced the Council and its Lutheran preachers. Riots were the consequence,
      many of the rioters being women, among whom the nuns of the &Uuml;berwasser
      convent were conspicuous. It was declared that all believers ought
      to be rebaptized, and that a list of the faithful ought to be made.
      The document contained fourteen hundred names within eight days. The
      mass of the people enthusiastically believed in the near approach of
      the Day of the Lord.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards (Jan. 13th, 1533), Jan Bockelson (John of Leyden) entered
      the town. He was the favourite disciple and <i>alter ego</i> of Jan
      Matthys. He brought with him the famous Twenty-one Articles, and called
      upon the faithful to unite themselves into a compact organisation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg
      460]</a></span> pledged to carry them out. He was received with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The Council, feeling their helplessness, appealed to the Bishop, who contented
      himself with ordering them to execute the imperial mandate against
      Anabaptists. He was as much incensed against the Lutherans as against
      the Anabaptists, and hoped that the two parties would destroy themselves.
      Within the town, Anabaptists fought with the combined Evangelicals
      and Romanists, and on two occasions the tumults were succeeded by truces
      which guaranteed full liberty of worship to all persons (Jan. 28th
      and Feb. 9th). Then the Council abandoned the struggle. The principal
      Burgomaster, Tylbeck, was baptized, and Van der Wieck, with many of
      the principal citizens, left the town. Van der Wieck fell into the
      hands of the Bishop, who slaughtered him barbarously.</p>
<p>A new Council, entirely Anabaptist, was elected, with Bernardin Knipperdolling
      and Gerhard Kibbenbroick, a leading merchant, as Burgomasters (Feb.
      28th). The complete rule of the Anabaptists had begun. This date also
      marks the beginning of the investment of the city by the Bishop&rsquo;s troops.
      It should never be forgotten, as it frequently is, that during the <i>whole</i> period
      of Anabaptist domination in M&uuml;nster the town was undergoing the
      perils of a siege, and that military considerations <i>had</i> to be
      largely kept in mind. Nor should it be forgotten that during its existence
      the Bishop&rsquo;s troops were murdering in cold blood every Anabaptist they
      could lay their hands on.</p>
<p>Jan Matthys himself had come to M&uuml;nster some time in February, urged
      thereto by a letter from Bockelson, and the citizens had become accustomed
      to see the long lean figure of the prophet, with his piercing eyes
      and flowing black beard, pass to and fro in their streets. They had
      learned to hang breathless on his words as his sonorous voice repeated
      the message which the Lord had given him to utter, or described the
      visions which had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg
      461]</a></span> vouchsafed to him. When an Anabaptist Council ruled
      the city they were but the mouthpiece of the prophet. His reign was
      brief, but while it lasted he issued command after command.</p>
<p>Separation from the world was one of the ideas he dwelt upon in his addresses;
      and to him this meant that no unbelievers, no unbaptized, could remain
      within the walls of an Anabaptist city. The command went forth that
      all adults must be baptized or leave the town. It is scarcely to be
      wondered that, with the great likelihood of falling into the hands
      of the Bishop&rsquo;s soldiers as soon as they got beyond the walls, the
      great majority of those who had not yet received the seal of the new
      communion submitted to the ceremony. They were marched to the market-place,
      where they found &ldquo;three or more&rdquo; Anabaptist preachers, each with a
      great vessel full of water before them. The neophytes knelt down, received
      the usual admonition, and a dish of water was thrice emptied on their
      heads in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. This
      done, they went to the Burgomaster&rsquo;s house and had their names entered
      on the roll.<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a></p>
<p>It was also by Matthys&rsquo; orders that what is called the communism of M&uuml;nster
      was begun. The duty of systematic and brotherly charity had from the
      first been an outstanding one among the Anabaptists. Like all other
      principles which find immediate outcome in action, this one of brotherly
      love had found many ways of taking actual shape. In a few of the smaller
      sections of the brethren it had appeared in the form of communism so
      far as food and raiment went. In some of the communities in Moravia
      the Brethren subscribed to a common fund out of which common meals
      were provided; and these payments were compulsory. We have seen how
      Rothmann&rsquo;s sermons had produced an extraordinary outburst of benevolence
      in M&uuml;nster before the coming of the prophets.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg
      462]</a></span> It does not appear that Matthys&rsquo; commands went further
      than the exhortations of Rothmann. M&uuml;nster was a beleaguered city.
      When the siege began it contained about seventeen hundred men, between
      five and six thousand women, besides thousands of children. The largest
      proportion of these were refugees. It is evident that numbers could
      not support themselves, but were absolutely dependent upon the charity
      of their neighbours. The preachers invited the faithful to give up
      their money, and what provisions they could spare to feed the poverty
      striken. Large numbers thus appealed to brought all their portable
      property; others gave part; some refused, and were denounced publicly.
      The provisions stored in the monasteries or in private houses abandoned
      by their proprietors&mdash;were taken for the common good. When the
      siege had lasted long, and the enemy were deliberately starving the
      inhabitants into surrender, the communism in food became stricter,
      as is the case in any beleaguered fortress. No attempt was ever made
      to institute a thoroughgoing communism. What existed at first was simply
      an abundant Christian charity enforced by public opinion,<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> and
      latterly a requisitioning of everything that could be used to support
      the whole population of a besieged city.</p>
<p>Jan Matthys did not long survive his coming to M&uuml;nster. On the evening
      of the 4th of April, as he sat at supper in a friend&rsquo;s house, he was
      observed to spend long minutes in brooding. At last, sighing heavily,
      he was heard to ejaculate, &ldquo;Loved Father, not my will but Thine be
      done.&rdquo; He rose quietly from his seat, shook hands with all his companions,
      solemnly kissed each one; then left the house in silence, accompanied
      by his wife. Next day with about twenty companions he went out by one
      of the gates of the city, fell fiercely on the enemy, was overpowered
      by numbers, and received his death-stroke.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg
      463]</a></span> A religious enthusiast and a singularly straightforward
      and courageous man!</p>
<p>His death depressed the defenders of M&uuml;nster greatly; but they were
      rallied by the persuasive eloquence of Jan Bockelson, the favourite
      disciple of the dead prophet. It was under the leadership of Bockelson&mdash;Jan
      of Leyden he was called&mdash;that the Town Council of M&uuml;nster
      was abolished; that twelve elders were chosen to rule the people; that
      Jan himself became king, and had his Court; that the old miracle plays
      were revived, etc. The only one of the many actions of this highly
      talented and eloquent young Dutchman which need concern us was the
      institution of polygamy, for which he seems to have been almost solely
      responsible.</p>
<p>Polygamy is the one dark stain on the Anabaptists of M&uuml;nster, and
      one that is ineffaceable. Not unnaturally, yet quite unjustly, the
      fact of its institution has been used continually to blacken the character
      of the whole movement. It was an episode, a lamentable one, in the
      history of Anabaptism in M&uuml;nster; it had nothing to do with the
      brethren outside the town. The whole question presents difficulties
      which, with our present information, cannot be removed. That men whose
      whole past lives had been examples of the most correct moral behaviour,
      and who had been influenced by deep and earnest religious feelings,
      should suddenly (for it was sudden) have given the lie to their own
      previous teaching and to the tenets of every separate section of Anabaptism,
      that they should have sullied the last few months of an heroic and
      desperate defence within a doomed city by the institution of polygamy,
      is an insoluble puzzle.<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a></p>
<p>We are not now dependent for our knowledge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg
                  464]</a></span> the Anabaptist movement on the writings
                  of embittered opponents, or upon such tainted sources as
                  confessions of martyrs wrung from them under torture. The
                  diligence of arch&aelig;ologists has exhumed a long list
                  of writings of the leaders in the rising. They give us
                  trustworthy accounts of the opinions and teachings of almost
                  every sect classed under the common name. We know what
                  they thought about all the more important matters which
                  were in controversy during the sixteenth century&mdash;what
                  they taught about Free Will, Original Sin, Justification,
                  the Trinity, the Person of Christ, and so on. We have clear
                  glimpses of the kind of lives they led&mdash;a genuinely
                  pious, self-denying, Christian walk and conversation. Their
                  teaching was often at variance with the Romanist and the
                  Lutheran doctrinal confessions; but they never varied from
                  the moral life which all Christians are called upon to
                  live. Their writings seldom refer to marriage; but when
                  they do it is always to bear witness to the universal and
                  deeply rooted Christian sentiment that marriage is a sacred
                  and unbreakable union of one man with one woman. Nay more,
                  one document has descended to us which bears testimony
                  to the teaching of the Anabaptists within the beleaguered
                  city only a few weeks before the proclamation of polygamy.
                  It is entitled <i>Bekentones des globens und lebens der
                  gemein Criste zu Monster</i>,<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> and
                  was meant to be an answer to calumnies circulated by their
                  enemies. It contains a paragraph on Marriage which is a
                  clear and distinct assertion that the only Christian marriage
                  is the unbreakable union of one man with one woman.<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a></p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></p>
<p>It is true that the Anabaptist thought of &ldquo;separation,&rdquo;
      when carried out in its most extreme way and to its utmost logical
            consequences, struck a blow at the sanctity of the marriage tie.
            All taught that the &ldquo;believer,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> he or she who had
            been rebaptized, ought to keep themselves separate from the &ldquo;world,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> those
            who had not submitted to rebaptism; and in the more extreme sects
            it was alleged that this meant that spouses ought not to cohabit
            with &ldquo;unbelieving&rdquo; partners. This was held and practised among
            the <i>Melchiorites</i>, and was stated in its extremest form
            in the Twenty-one Rules sent to M&uuml;nster by Jan Matthys by
            the hand of Bockelson. They contained two prescriptions&mdash;one
            for the unmarried, which exhorted them only to marry in the Lord;
            another for the married, which implies that marriage contracted
            between husband and wife before rebaptism ought to be repeated.
            This meant that marriages contracted by persons yet &ldquo;in the world&rdquo; were
            not valid, and, of course, destroyed the sanctity of all marriages
            outside the circle of the brethren. But when a <i>Melchiorite</i> at
            Strassburg, Klaus Frey, whose wife was not an Anabaptist, carried
            out the principle to its logical consequences and married an
            Anabaptist woman, his &ldquo;unbelieving&rdquo; wife being alive, he was
            promptly excommunicated.</p>
<p>When the information to be gathered from the various sources is combined,
      what took place in M&uuml;nster seems to have been as follows. Sometime
      in July (1534), John Bockelson summoned the preachers, Rothmann at
      their head, and the twelve elders to meet him in the <i>Rathaus</i>.
      There he propounded to them his proposal to inaugurate polygamy, and
      argued the matter with them for eight successive days. We are told
      that Rothmann and the preachers opposed the scheme in a determined
      manner. The arguments used by the prophet&mdash;arguments of the flimsiest
      nature&mdash;have also been recorded. He dwelt on the necessity of
      accepting certain biblical expressions in their most literal sense,
      and in giving them their widest application. He insisted especially
      on the command of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg
      466]</a></span> God, <i>Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the
      earth</i>; he brought forward the example of the patriarchs and other
      examples of polygamy from the Old Testament; he went the length of
      saying that when St. Paul insisted that bishops must be husbands of
      one wife, the phrase implied that all who were not bishops were free
      to take more than one; he dwelt on the special conditions existing
      among the population within the town,&mdash;the number of male refugees,
      either unmarried or who had left their wives behind them in the places
      from which they had fled; the disproportionate number of women (more
      than three women for every man),&mdash;and the difficulties thereby
      created to prevent them from obeying the command of God to be fruitful
      and increase; and he urged that in their present condition the command
      of God could only be obeyed by means of polygamy.</p>
<p>In the end he brought preachers and elders round to his opinion; and in
      spite of opportunities given them for revolt, they remained steadfast
      to it. They preached upon its advantages for three days to the people
      in the Cathedral square; and it was Rothmann who proclaimed the decree
      commanding polygamy to the people. How were the preachers persuaded
      to forego their opposition? What one of the threadbare arguments used
      by the prophet convinced them? Had he proclaimed polygamy as a divine
      command received by him as a prophet, we might imagine the preachers
      and people, such was the exalted state of their minds, receiving it
      with reverence; but the prophet did not announce that he had received
      any such message. He relied solely upon his arguments. They did not
      convince all the people. The proclamation of polygamy awoke violent
      protests upon the part of the native townsmen, who, headed by a &ldquo;master-smith&rdquo; named
      M&ouml;llenbecke, felt that they would rather hand over the city to
      the Bishop&rsquo;s forces than live in a polygamist society, and the revolt
      was almost successful; but the preachers stood firm in their support
      of the prophet and of his polygamy; and it was the women who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg
      467]</a></span> mainly instrumental in causing the revolt to be a failure.</p>
<p>If we are to judge by the use made of it in Rothmann&rsquo;s <i>Restitution</i>,<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> which
      defends the introduction of the new marriage laws, the preachers seem
      to have been most impressed by the argument which dwelt on the condition
      of the city&mdash;the large proportion of men whose wives were in the
      towns they had abandoned to take refuge in M&uuml;nster, and the great
      multitude of women. It is just possible that it was this economic argument
      that affected both them and the prophet himself. This is the view taken
      by such writers as Kautsky, Belfort Bax, and Heath. The explanation
      is confirmed by the fact that the decree was more than a proclamation
      of polygamy. It provided that <i>all</i> marriageable men must take
      wives, and that <i>all</i> women must be under the care of a husband.
      The laws against sexual irregularity were as strong during the reign
      of polygamy as before its introduction. But there is this to be said
      against it, that the town of M&uuml;nster, notwithstanding its abnormal
      conditions, was singularly pure in life, and that polygamy, so far
      from improving the moral condition, made it distinctly worse.</p>
<p>Detmer, whose opinions are always worthy of respect, believes than Jan
      of Leyden had fallen violently in love with the young, beautiful, and
      intellectual Divara, the widow of Jan Matthys, and that, as he could
      not marry her apart from polygamy, he persuaded his preachers and elders
      to consent to his proposals. His wonderful magnetic influence overbore
      their better judgment.</p>
<p>What is evident is that the decree of polygamy was suddenly conceived
      and forced upon the people. If Jan of Leyden<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> took
      no share in its proclamation, he set the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg
      468]</a></span> people an example of obedience. He promptly married
      Divara as soon as it was lawful to do so. He used the ordinance to
      strengthen his position. His other wives&mdash;he had sixteen in all&mdash;were
      the daughters or near relations of the leaders in M&uuml;nster. There
      is evidence to show that his own character deteriorated rapidly under
      the new conditions of life.</p>
<p>The siege of M&uuml;nster went on during all these months. The Bishop&rsquo;s
      soldiers attempted several assaults, and were always beaten back. They
      seem latterly to have relied on the power of hunger. The sufferings
      of the citizens during the later weeks were terrible. At length Heinrich
      Gresbeck, deserting to the besiegers&rsquo; camp, offered to betray the city
      to its enemies. He showed them, by plans and models in clay, how to
      get through the defences, and himself prepared the way for the Bishop&rsquo;s
      soldiers to enter. The Anabaptists gathered for one last desperate
      defence in the market-place, under the leadership of Bernardin Knipperdolling
      and Bernard Krechting, with Rothmann by their side. When the band was
      reduced to three hundred men, they capitulated on promise of safe-conduct
      to leave the town. It is needless to say that the bargain was not kept.
      Rothmann was believed to have perished in the market-place. The city
      was given over to pillage, and the streets were soon strewn with dead
      bodies. Then a court was established to try the Anabaptist prisoners.
      The first woman to suffer was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg
      469]</a></span> fair young Divara. She steadfastly refused to abjure,
      and met her fate in her own queenly way. No man who had been in any
      way prominent during the siege was allowed to escape death. Jan Bockelson,
      Bernardin Knipperdolling, and Bernard Krechting were reserved to suffer
      the most terrible tortures that the diabolical ingenuity of medi&aelig;val
      executioners could devise. It was long believed that Rothmann had escaped,
      and that he had got away to Rostock or to L&uuml;beck; more than one
      person was arrested on the suspicion of being the famous preacher of
      M&uuml;nster&mdash;&ldquo;a short, dark man, with straight brown hair,&rdquo; was
      his description in the L&uuml;beck handbills.</p>
<p>The horrible fate of M&uuml;nster did not destroy the indomitable Anabaptists.
      Menno Simons (b. 1496 or 1505 at Witmarsum, a village near Franecker), &ldquo;a
      man of integrity, mild, accommodating, patient of injuries, and so
      ardent in his piety as to exemplify in his own life the precepts he
      gave to others,&rdquo; spent twenty-five laborious years in visiting the
      scattered Anabaptist communities and uniting them in a simple brotherly
      association. He purged their minds of the apocalyptic fancies taught
      by many of their later leaders under the influence of persecution,
      inculcated the old ideas of non-resistance, of the evils of State control
      over the Church, of the need of personal conversion, and of adult baptism
      as its sign and seal. From his labours have come all the modern Baptist
      Churches.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3>SOCINIANISM.<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a></h3>
<p>The fathers of the Socinian Church were the two Sozzini, uncle and nephew,
      Lelio and Fausto, both natives of the town of Siena.</p>
<p>The uncle, Lelio Sozzini (b. 1525), was by profession a lawyer. He was
      a man of irreproachable moral life, a Humanist by training, a student
      of the classics and also of theology. He was thoroughly dissatisfied
      with the condition of the Romish Church, and early began to entertain
      grave doubts about some of its leading doctrinal positions. He communicated
      his views to a select circle of friends. Notwithstanding the precautions
      he had taken, he became suspected. Cardinal Caraffa had persuaded Pope
      Paul <span class="smcap">III.</span> to consent to the reorganisation
      of the Inquisition in 1542, and Italy soon became a very unsafe place
      for any suspected person. Lelio left Siena in 1547, and spent the remaining
      portion of his life in travelling in those lands which had accepted
      the Lutheran or the Reformed faith. He made the acquaintance of all
      the leading Protestant theologians, including Melanchthon and Calvin.
      He kept up an extensive correspondence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg
      471]</a></span> with them, representing his own personal theological
      opinions in the form of questions which he desired to have solved for
      him. From Calvin&rsquo;s letters we can learn that the great theologian had
      grave doubts about the moral earnestness of his Italian correspondent,
      and repeatedly warned him that he was losing hold on the saving facts
      of heart religion.</p>
<p>All the while Sozzini seems to have made up his mind already on all the
      topics introduced into his correspondence, and to have been communicating
      his views, on pledge of secrecy, to the small communities of Italian
      refugees who were settled in Switzerland. He can scarcely be blamed
      for this secretiveness; toleration, as the sad example of the burning
      of Servede had shown, was not recognised to be a Christian principle
      among the Churches of the Reformation. Lelio died at Zurich in 1562
      without having published his opinions, and without his neighbours and
      hosts being aware of his real theological position.</p>
<p>He bequeathed all his property, including his books and his manuscripts,
      to his nephew, Fausto, who had remained at Siena. This nephew was the
      founder of the Socinian Church.</p>
<p>Fausto Sozzini (b. 1539) was, like his uncle, a man of irreproachable
      life, a lawyer, a diligent and earnest student, fond of theology, and
      of great force of character. How early he had come to think as his
      uncle had done, is unknown. Report affirms that after he had received
      his uncle&rsquo;s books and papers, and had given sufficient time to their
      study, he left Italy, visited the places where Lelio had gathered small
      companies of secret sympathisers, to confirm them in the faith. His
      uncle had visited Poland twice, and Fausto went there in 1579. He found
      that the anti-Trinitarians there had no need to conceal their opinions.
      The Transylvanian Prince, Stephen B&aacute;thory, protected them, and
      they had in the town of Krakau their own church, school, and printing-press.
      But the sect as a whole was torn by internal divisions. Fausto bent
      his whole energies to overcome these differences.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></p>
<p>Before his arrival in Poland he had published two books, which are interesting
      because they show the pathway by which Fausto arrived at his theological
      conclusions. He started not with the doctrines of the Trinity or of
      the Person of Christ, but with the doctrine of the Atonement&mdash;a
      fact to be kept in mind when the whole Socinian system of theology
      is examined.</p>
<p>He believed that the real cause of the divisions which wasted the sect
      was that the Polish Unitarians were largely Anabaptists. They insisted
      that no one could be a recognised member of the community unless he
      was rebaptized. They refused to enroll Fausto Sozzini himself, and
      excluded him from the Sacrament of the Supper, because he would not
      submit to rebaptism. They declared that no member of their communities
      could enter the magistracy, or sue in a civil court, or pay a war tax.
      They disagreed on many small points of doctrine, and used the ban very
      freely against each other. Sozzini saw that he could not hope to make
      any progress in his attempts to unite the Unitarians unless he was
      able to purge out this Anabaptist leaven. His troubles can be seen
      in his correspondence, and in some of his smaller tracts in the first
      volume of the <i>Bibliotheca Fratrum Polonorum</i>.<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> In
      spite of the rebuffs he met with, he devoted all his energies to the
      thankless task of furthering union, and in the end of his days he had
      the satisfaction of seeing that he had not laboured in vain. Shortly
      before his death, a synod held at Krakau (1603) declared that rebaptism
      was not necessary for entrance into a Unitarian community. Many of
      the lesser differences had been got rid of earlier. The literary activity
      of Sozzini was enormous: books and pamphlets flowed from his untiring
      pen, all devoted to the enforcing or explaining the Socinian theology.
      It is not too much to say that the inner history of the Unitarian communities
      in Poland from 1579 until his death in 1604 is contained in his voluminous
      correspondence. The united Unitarians of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg
      473]</a></span> Poland took the name of the <i>Polish Brethren</i>;
      and from this society what was known as Socinian theology spread through
      Germany (especially the Rhineland), Switzerland, and England. Its principles
      were not formulated in a creed until 1642, when the <i>Racovian Catechism</i> was
      published. It was never formally declared to be the standard of the
      Unitarian Church, but its statements are universally held to represent
      the views of the older Socinians.</p>
<p>Socinianism, unlike the great religious movement under the guidance of
      Luther, had its distinct and definite beginning in a criticism of doctrines,
      and this must never be forgotten if its true character is to be understood.
      We have already seen<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> that
      there is no trace of any intellectual difficulties about doctrines
      or statement of doctrines in Luther&rsquo;s mind during the supreme crisis
      in his spiritual history. Its whole course, from the time he entered
      the Erfurt convent down to the publication of the Augsburg Confession,
      shows that the spiritual revolt of which he was the soul and centre
      took its rise from something much deeper than any mere criticism of
      the doctrines of the medi&aelig;val Church, and that it resulted in
      something very much greater than a reconstruction of doctrinal conceptions.
      The central thing about the Protestant Reformation was that it meant
      a rediscovery of religion as <i>faith</i>, &ldquo;as a relation between person
      and person, higher therefore, than all reason, and living not upon
      commands and hopes, but on the power of God, and apprehending in Jesus
      Christ the Lord of heaven and earth as Father.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> The
      Reformation started from this living experience of the believing Christian,
      which it proclaimed to be the one fundamental fact in Christianity&mdash;something
      which could never be proved by argument, and could never be dissolved
      away by speculation.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the earliest glimpse that we have of Lelio Sozzini is
      his meeting with friends to discuss and cast doubts upon such doctrines
      as the Satisfaction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg
      474]</a></span> Christ, the Trinity, and others like them.<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> Socinianism
      maintained to the end the character with which it came into being.
      It was from first to last a criticism and attempted reconstruction
      of doctrines.</p>
<p>This is sufficient of itself to discount the usual accounts which Romanist
      controversialists give of the Socinian movement, and of its relation
      to the Protestant Reformation. They, and many Anglicans who have no
      sympathy with the great Reformation movement, are accustomed to say
      that the Socinian system of doctrines is the legitimate deduction from
      the principles of the Reformation, and courageously carries out the
      rationalist conceptions lurking in all Protestant theology. They point
      to the fact that many of the early Presbyterians of England and Puritans
      of America have furnished a large number of recruits to the Unitarian
      or Socinian ranks. They assert that the central point in the Socinian
      theology is the denial of the Divinity of our Lord, which they allege
      is the logical outcome of refusing to accept the Romanist doctrine
      of the Mass and the principle of ecclesiastical tradition.</p>
<p>The question is purely historical, and can only be answered by examining
      the sources of Socinian theology and tracing it to its roots. The result
      of such an examination seems to show that, while Socinianism did undoubtedly
      owe much to Humanism, and to the spirit of critical inquiry and keen
      sense of the value of the individual which it fostered, most of its
      distinguishing theological conceptions are medi&aelig;val. It laid
      hold on the leading principles of the Scotist-Pelagian theology, which
      were extremely popular in the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth
      centuries, and carried them out to their logical consequences. In fact,
      most of the theological principles of Socinian theology are more akin
      to those of the Jesuit dogmatic-which is the prolongation of Scotism
      into modern times&mdash;than they are to the theology of Luther or
      of Calvin. It is, of course, to be remembered that by discarding the
      authority of the Church the Socinians are widely separated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg
      475]</a></span> from both Scotists and Jesuits. Still the roots of
      Socinian theology are to be found in the Scotist doctrines of God and
      of the Atonement, and these two doctrines are their starting-point,
      and not the mere negation of the Divinity of Christ.</p>
<p>In three most important conceptions the Socinian thought is distinctly
      medi&aelig;val, and medi&aelig;val in the Scotist way.</p>
<p>Their idea of <i>faith</i> is intellectual. It is <i>assensus</i> and
      not <i>fiducia</i>. &ldquo;In Scripture,&rdquo; says the Racovian Catechism,
      &ldquo;the <i>faith</i> is most perfectly <i>taught</i>, that God exists
      and that He recompenses. This, however, and nothing else, is the faith
      that is to be directed to God and Christ.&rdquo; It is afterwards described
      as the way in which one must adjust himself to the known commands and
      promises of God; and there is added that this faith &ldquo;both makes our
      obedience more acceptable and well-pleasing to God, and supplies the
      defects of our obedience, provided it be sincere and earnest, and brings
      it about that we are justified by God.&rdquo; This is good Scotist doctrine.
      These theologians were accustomed to declare that all that the Christian
      needs is to have faith in God as the recompenser (<i>i.e.</i> to assent
      to the truth that God does recompense), and that with regard to all
      the other doctrines of the Church implicit faith (<i>i.e.</i> submission
      to the Church&rsquo;s teaching) is enough. Of course the extreme individualism
      of the Socinians coloured their conception of faith; they cannot accept
      an implicit faith; their assent to truth must always be explicit; what
      they assent to must recommend itself to their individual reason. They
      cannot assent to a round of truths which are presented to them by the
      Church, and receive them implicitly on the principle of obedience to
      authority. But what is to be observed here is that the Socinian type
      of faith is always assent to truths which can be stated in propositional
      form; they have no idea of that faith which, to use Luther&rsquo;s phrase,
      throws itself upon God. They further declare, quite in accordance with
      Scotist teaching, that men are justified because of their <i>actual</i> obedience
      to the <i>known</i> commands and promises of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg
      476]</a></span> God. There is not a trace of the Evangelical attitude.
      The accordance with Scotist theology descends to very minute particulars,
      did space permit to trace it.</p>
<p>The Socinian conception of <i>Scripture</i> corresponds to their idea
      of faith. The two thoughts of Scripture and saving faith, as has been
      already said,<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> always
      correspond in medi&aelig;val theology they are primarily intellectual
      and propositional; in Reformation thinking they are, in the first instance,
      experimental and personal. The Socinian conception allies itself with
      the medi&aelig;val, and discards the Reformation way of regarding both
      faith and Scripture. With the Socinians as with medi&aelig;val theologians,
      Scripture is the divine source of information about doctrines and morals;
      they have no idea of Scripture as a means of grace, as the channel
      of a personal communion between God and His trusting people. But here
      as elsewhere the new individualism of the Socinians compels them to
      establish both the authority and the dogmatic contents of Scripture
      in a way different from their medi&aelig;val predecessors. They had
      rejected altogether the authority of the Church, and they could not
      make use of the thought to warrant either the authority of Scripture
      or a correct interpretation of its contents. In the place of it they
      put what they called <i>reason</i>. &ldquo;The use of right reason (<i>rect&aelig; rationis</i>)
      is great in things which pertain to salvation, since without it, it
      is impossible either to grasp with certainty the authority of Scripture,
      or to understand those things that are contained in it, or to deduce
      some things from other things, or, finally, to recall them to put them
      to use (<i>ad usum revocari</i>).&rdquo; The <i>certitudo sacrarum litterarum</i> is
      accordingly established, or attempted to be proved, by a series of
      external proofs which appeal to the ordinary reasoning faculties of
      man. The Reformation conception of the Witness of the Spirit, an essential
      part of its doctrine of Scripture, finds no place in Socinian theology.
      They try to establish the authority of Scripture without any appeal
      to faith; the Confessions of the Reformation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg
      477]</a></span> do not recognise any infallibility or divine authority
      which is otherwise apprehended than by faith. The Reformation and the
      Socinian doctrines are miles apart; but the Socinian and the medi&aelig;val
      approach each other closely. It is somewhat difficult to know what
      books the older Socinians recognise as their rule of faith. They did
      not accept the Canon of the medi&aelig;val Church. They had no difficulty
      about the New Testament; but the references to the Old Testament in
      the Racovian Catechism are very slight: its authority is guaranteed
      for them by the references to it in the New Testament.</p>
<p>When we turn to the Socinian statements about <i>God</i>, and to their
      assertions about the <i>nature and meaning of the Work of Christ</i>,
      we find the clearest proof of their medi&aelig;val origin. The Scotist
      theology is simply reproduced, and cleared of its limitations.</p>
<p>A fundamental conception of God lay at the basis of the whole Scotist
      theology. God, it maintained, could best be defined as <i>Dominium
      Absolutum</i>; man as set over against God they described as an individual
      free will. If God be conceived as simply <i>Dominium Absolutum</i>,
      we can never affirm that God <i>must</i> act in any given way; we may
      not even say that He is bound to act according to moral considerations.
      He is high above all considerations of any kind. He does not will to
      act in any way because it is right; and action is right because God
      wills to act in that way. There can be neither metaphysical nor moral
      necessity in any of God&rsquo;s actions or purposes. This Scotist idea, that
      God is the absolutely arbitrary one, is expressed in the strongest
      language in the Racovian Catechism. &ldquo;It belongs to the nature of God
      that He has the right and supreme power to decree whatsoever He wills
      concerning all things and concerning us, even in those matters with
      which no other power has to do; for example, He can give laws, and
      appoint rewards and penalties according to His own judgment, to our
      thoughts, hidden as these may be in the innermost recesses of our hearts.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></p>
<p>If this thought, that God is simply <i>Dominium Absolutum</i>, be applied
      to explain the nature and meaning of the work of Christ, of the Atonement,
      it follows at once that there can be no real necessity for that work;
      for all necessity, metaphysical or moral, is derogatory to the <i>Dominium
      Absolutum</i>, which is God. If the Atonement has merit in it, that
      is only because God has announced that He means to accept the work
      of Christ as meritorious, and that He will therefore free men from
      the burden of sin on account of what Christ, the Saviour, has done.
      It is the announced <i>acceptation</i> of God which makes the work
      of Christ meritorious. A <i>meritorious</i> work has nothing in its
      nature which makes it so. To be meritorious simply means that the work
      so described will be followed by God&rsquo;s doing something in return for
      its being done, and this only because God has made this announcement.
      God could have freed men from the guilt and punishment due for sin
      without the work of Christ; He could have appointed a human mediator
      if He had so willed it; He might have pardoned and accepted man as
      righteous in His sight without any mediator at all. He could have simply
      pardoned man without anything coming between His act of pardon and
      man&rsquo;s sin. This being the case, the Scotist theologians argued that
      it might seem that the work of Christ, called the Atonement, was entirely
      superfluous; it is, indeed, superfluous as far as reason is concerned;
      it can never be justified on rational grounds. But, according to the
      dogmatic tradition of the Church, confirmed by the circle of the Sacraments,
      God has selected this mode of getting rid of the sin and guilt of man.
      He has announced that He will <i>accept</i> this work of Christ, Atonement,
      and therefore the Scotist theologians declared the Atonement must be
      believed in and seen to be the divinely appointed way of salvation.
      Erasmus satirised the long arguments and hypotheses of the Scotist
      theologians when he enumerated among the questions which were highly
      interesting to them: &ldquo;Could God have taken the form of a woman, a devil,
      an ass, a gourd, or a stone? How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg
      479]</a></span> could a gourd have preached, done miracles, hung on
      the Cross?&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a></p>
<p>It is manifest that this idea of <i>Dominium Absolutum</i> is simply the
      conception of the extremest individualism applied to God instead of
      being used to describe man. If we treat it anthropomorphically, it
      comes to this, that the relation of God to man is that of an infinite
      Individual Will set over against a number of finite individual wills.
      If this view be taken of the relations between God and man, then God
      can never be thought of as the Moral Ruler in a moral commonwealth,
      but only as a private individual face to face with other individuals;
      and the relations between God and man must be discussed from the standpoint
      of private and not of public law. When wrong-doing is regarded under
      the scheme of public law, the ruler can never treat it as an injury
      done to himself, and which he can forgive because he is of a kindly
      nature; he must consider it an offence against the whole community
      of which he is the public guardian. On the other hand, when offences
      are considered under a scheme of private law, they are simply wrongs
      done to a private person who, as an individual, may forgive what is
      merely a debt due to himself. In such a case the wrong-doer may be
      forgiven without infringing any general moral principle.</p>
<p>The Socinians, following the medi&aelig;val Scotist theologians, invariably
      applied the principles of private law to the relations between God
      and man. God, the <i>Dominium Absolutum</i>, the Supreme Arbitrary
      Will, was never regarded as the Moral Ruler in a moral commonwealth
      where subjects and rulers are constrained by the same moral laws. Sins
      are simply private debts due by the individual finite wills to the
      One Infinite Will. From such premises the Scotists deduced the conclusion
      that the Atonement was unnecessary; there they stopped; they could
      not say that there was no such thing as Atonement, for the dogmatic
      tradition of the Church prevented them. The Socinians had thrown overboard
      the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span> thought
      of a dogmatic tradition which had to be respected even when it appeared
      to be irrational. If the Atonement was not necessary, that meant to
      them that it did not exist; they simply carried out the theological
      premises of the Scotist-Pelagian medi&aelig;val theologians to their
      legitimate consequences.</p>
<p>In these three important conceptions&mdash;faith, Scripture, the nature
      of God, involving the character of His relations to man&mdash;the Socinians
      belong to a medi&aelig;val school of thought, and have no sympathy
      whatever with the general principles which inspired Reformation theological
      thinking.</p>
<p>But the Socinians were not exclusively medi&aelig;val; they owed much
      to the Renaissance. This appears in a very marked manner in the way
      in which they conceived the very important religious conception of
      the <i>Church</i>. It is a characteristic of Socinian theology, that
      the individual believer is considered without much, if any, reference
      to the Church or community of the saved. This separates the Socinians
      not only from medi&aelig;val Christians, but from all who belonged
      to the great Protestant Evangelical movement.</p>
<p>The medi&aelig;val Church always regarded itself, and taught men to look
      to it, as a religious community which came logically and really before
      the individual believer. It presented itself to men as a great society
      founded on a dogmatic tradition, possessing the Sacraments, and governed
      by an officially holy caste. The pious layman of the Middle Ages found
      himself within it as he might have done within one of its great cathedrals.
      The dogmatic tradition did not trouble him much, nor did the worldliness
      and insincerity often manifested by its official guardians. What they
      required of him was implicit faith, which really meant a decorous external
      obedience. That once rendered, he was comparatively free to worship
      within what was for him a great house of prayer. The hymns, the prayers,
      many of the sermons of the medi&aelig;val Church, make us feel that
      the Institution was for the medi&aelig;val Christian the visible symbol
      of a wide purpose of God, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg
      481]</a></span> embraced his individual life and guaranteed a repose
      which he could use in resting on the promises of God. The records of
      medi&aelig;val piety continually show us that the Church was etherealised
      into an assured and historical fellowship of believers into which the
      individual entered, and within which he found the assuring sense of
      fellowship. He left all else to the professional guardians of this
      ecclesiastical edifice. Probably such are the unspoken thoughts of
      thousands of devout men and women in the Roman and Greek communions
      to-day. They value the Church because it represents to them in a visible
      and historical way a fellowship with Christ and His saints which is
      the result of His redeeming work.</p>
<p>This thought is as deeply rooted in Reformation as in medi&aelig;val piety.
      The Reformers felt compelled to protest against the political form
      which the medi&aelig;val Church had assumed. They conceived that to
      be a degradation from its ideal. They saw the manifold abuses which
      the degradation had given rise to. But they always regarded visible
      Christendom as a religious community called into being by the work
      of Christ. They had always before them the thought of the Church of
      Christ as the fellowship which logically and really comes <i>before</i> the
      individual believer, the society into which the believer is brought;
      and this conception stood with them in close and reciprocal connection
      with the thought that Jesus, by His work of Atonement, had reconciled
      men with God, had founded the Church on that work of His, and, <i>within</i> it
      had opened for sinners the way to God. They protested against the political
      form which the Church had assumed; they never ceased to cling to the
      thought of the Catholic Church Visible which is founded on the redeeming
      work of Christ, and within which man finds the way of salvation. They
      described this Church in all their creeds and testimonies; they gave
      the marks which characterised it and manifested its divine origin;
      the thought was an essential part of their theology.</p>
<p>The Socinians never felt the need of any such conception.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg
                  482]</a></span> Jesus was for them only the teacher of
                  a superior kind of morality detailed in the commands and
                  promises of God; they looked to Him for that guidance and
                  impulse towards a moral self-culture which each man can
                  appropriate for himself without first coming into a society
                  which is the fellowship of the redeemed. Had they ever
                  felt the burden of sin as the Reformers felt it, had they
                  ever yearned for such a fellowship with Christ as whole-hearted
                  personal trust gives, or even for such as comes in the
                  sense of bodily contact in the Sacrament, had they ever
                  felt the craving to get in touch with their Lord <i>somehow</i> or <i>anyhow</i>,
                  they would never have been able to do without this conception
                  of a Church Catholic of some kind or other. They never
                  seemed to feel the need of it. The Racovian Catechism was
                  compelled to make some reference to the kingly and priestly
                  offices of Christ. It owed so much to the New Testament.
                  Its perfunctory sentences show that our Lord was for the
                  Socinians simply a Prophet sent from God to proclaim a
                  superior kind of morality. His highest function was to
                  communicate knowledge to men, and perhaps to teach them
                  by example how to make use of it. They had no conception
                  that Jesus came to <i>do</i> something for His people,
                  and that what He <i>did</i> was much more valuable than
                  what He said, however precious that might be. They were
                  content to become His scholars, the scholars of a teacher
                  sent from God, and to become members of His school, where
                  His opinions were known and could be learned. They had
                  no idea that they needed to be saved in the deeper sense
                  of that word. They have no need, therefore, for the conception
                  of the Church; what they did need and what they have is
                  the thought of a school of opinions to which they could
                  belong.<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a></p>
<p>In this one thought they were equally far apart from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg
                  483]</a></span> the circle of medi&aelig;val and of Reformation
                  theological thinking. In most of their other theological
                  conceptions their opinions were inherited from medi&aelig;val
                  theology. They had little or no connection with Reformation
                  theology or with what that represents&mdash;the piety of
                  the medi&aelig;val Church.</p>

<h3>THE NECESSITY OF A REFORMATION OF SOME SORT UNIVERSALLY ADMITTED.<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a></h3>
<p>In the end of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth centuries the
      urgent need for a Reformation of the Church was recognised by all thoughtful
      men everywhere throughout western Europe, and was loudly expressed
      by almost everyone outside the circle of the influence of the Roman
      Curia. Statesmen and men of letters, nobles and burghers, great Churchmen
      as well as monks and parish priests&mdash;all bewailed the condition
      of the organised Christian life, and most of them recognised that the
      unreformed Papacy was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg
      485]</a></span> the running sore of Europe. The protest against the
      state of religion was not confined to individual outcries; it found
      expression in the States-General of France, in Diet of Germany, and
      in the Parliament of England.</p>
<p>The complaints took many forms. One of the most universal was that the
      clergy, especially those of higher rank, busied themselves with everything
      save the one thing which specially belonged to them&mdash;the cure
      of souls. They took undue share in the government of the countries
      of Europe, and ousted the nobles from their legitimate places of rule.
      Clerical law-courts interfered constantly with the lives of burghers;
      and the clergy protested that they were not bound to obey the ordinary
      laws of the land. A brawling priest could plead the &ldquo;benefit of clergy&rdquo;;
      but a layman who struck a priest, no matter what the provocation, was
      liable to the dread penalty of excommunication. Their &ldquo;right of sanctuary&rdquo; was
      a perpetual encouragement to crime.<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> They
      and their claims menaced the quiet life of civilised towns and States.
      Constitutional lawyers, trained by Humanism to know the old imperial
      law codes of Theodosius and Justinian, traced these evils back to the
      interference of Canon Law with Civil, and that to the universal and
      absolute dominion of a papal absolutism. The Reformation desired, floated
      before the minds of statesmen as a reduction more or less thorough
      of the papal absolutism, and of the control exercised by the Pope and
      the clergy over the internal affairs of the State, even its national
      ecclesiastical regulations. The historical fact that the loosely formed
      kingdoms of the Middle Ages were being slowly transformed into modern
      States, perhaps furnished unconsciously the basis for this idea of
      a Reformation.</p>
<p>The same thought took another and more purely ecclesiastical form. The
      papal absolutism meant frequently that Italians received preferments
      all over western Europe, and supplanted the native clergy in the more
      important and richer benefices. Why should the Churches of Spain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg
      486]</a></span> England, or France be ruled by Italian prelates, whether
      resident or non-resident? It was universally felt that Roman rule meant
      a lack of spirituality, and was a source of religious as well as of
      national degradation. Men longed for a change, clergy as well as laity;
      and the thought of National Churches really independent of Rome, if
      still nominally under the Western Obedience, filled the minds of many
      Reformers.<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a></p>
<p>The early medi&aelig;val Church had been a stern preacher of righteousness,
      had taught the barbarous invaders of Europe lessons of pure living,
      honesty, sobriety; it had insisted that the clergy ought to be examples
      as well as preachers; Canon Law was full of penalties ordained to check
      clerical vices. But it was notorious that the higher clergy, whose
      duty it was to put the laws in execution, were themselves the worst
      offenders. How could English Bishops enforce laws against incontinence,
      when Wolsey, Archbishop, Cardinal, and Legate, had made his illegitimate
      daughter the Abbess of Salisbury? What hope was there for strict discipline
      when no inconsiderable portion of a Bishop&rsquo;s annual income came from
      money paid in order to practise clerical incontinence in security?
      Reformers demanded a reformation of clerical morals, beginning with
      the Bishops and descending through all grades to monks and nuns.<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a></p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></p>
<p>Humanism brought forward yet another conception of reform. It demanded
      either a thorough repudiation of the whole of Scholastic Theology and
      a return to the pure and simple &ldquo;Christian Philosophy&rdquo; of the Church
      of the first six centuries, or such a relaxation of that Scholastic
      as would afford room for the encouragement of the New Learning.</p>
<p>Lastly, a few pious souls, with the clear vision of God which purity and
      simplicity of heart and mind give, declared that the Church had lost
      religion itself, and that the one reformation needed was the rediscovery
      of religion and the gracious enlightenment of the individual heart
      and conscience.<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a></p>
<p>The first conception of a reformation which looked for a cure of the evils
      which all acknowledged to the supremacy of the secular over ecclesiastical
      rule, may be seen in the reformation of the local Churches of Brandenburg
      and Saxony under Frederick of Brandenburg and William of Saxony. Archbishop
      Cranmer believed that the only way of removing the evils under which
      the Church of the later Middle Ages was groaning was to subordinate
      the ecclesiastical to the secular powers. The reformation of the Church
      of England under Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> carried out
      this idea to practical issue, but involved with it a nominal as well
      as a real destruction of the political unity of the medi&aelig;val
      Church. His actions were carefully watched and admired by many of the
      German Romanist Princes, who made more than one attempt, about the
      year 1540, to create a National Church in Germany under secular guidance,
      and remaining true to medi&aelig;val doctrine, hierarchy, and ritual.<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> The
      thought of a reformation of this kind was so familiar to men of the

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>THE SPANISH CONCEPTION OF A REFORMATION.<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a></h3>
<h3>&sect; 1. <i>The Religious Condition of Spain.</i></h3>
<p>The country, however, where all these various conceptions of what was
      meant by a reformation of the Church were combined in one definite
      scheme of reform which was carried through successfully, was Spain.
      It is to that country one must turn to see what medi&aelig;valists,
      who were at the same time reformers, wished to effect, and what they
      meant by a reformation of the Church. It included a measure of secular
      control, a revival and enforcement of all canonical laws framed to
      purify the morals of the clergy, a measured accommodation with Humanism,
      a steady adherence to the main doctrines of the Scholastic Theology,
      the preservation in their entirety of the hierarchy, the rites and
      the usages of the medi&aelig;val Church, and a ruthless suppression
      of heresy. Spain furnishes the example of what has been called the
      Catholic Reformation.</p>
<p>In Spain, as nowhere else in medi&aelig;val Europe, the firm maintenance
      of the Christian religion and patriotism had been felt to be one and
      the same thing. The seven hundred years&rsquo; war, which the Christians
      of Spain had waged with the Moors, had given strength and tenacity
      to their religious sentiments, and their experience as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg
      489]</a></span> Christians in daily battle with an enemy of alien race
      and alien faith, left to themselves in their Peninsula, cut off from
      the rest of Europe, had made them cling all the more closely to that
      visible solidarity of all Christian people which found expression in
      the medi&aelig;val conception of the medi&aelig;val Catholic Church.
      Spain had given birth to the great missionary monastic order of the
      Dominicans,
      &mdash;the leaders of an intellectual crusade against the penetrating
      influence of a Moslem pantheism (Averroism),
      &mdash;and to the great repressive agency of the Inquisition in its
      sternest and most savage form. It was Spain that was to furnish the
      Counter-Reformation, with its most devoted leader, Ignatius Loyola,
      and with its strongest body of combatants, the Society of Jesus which
      he founded.</p>
<p>It need scarcely be wondered at that it was in Spain that we find the
      earliest systematic attempts made to save the Church from the blindness
      and perversity of its rulers by the interposition of the secular authority
      to combat the deteriorating influence of the Roman Curia upon the local
      Church, and to restore discipline among the clergy. The Cortes of the
      various small kingdoms of the Spanish Peninsula repeatedly interfered
      to limit the overgrowth of clerical privileges, to insist on the submission
      of the clergy to the common law of the land, and to prevent the too
      great preponderance of clerical influence in secular administration.
      The ordinances of their Kings were used, time after time, to counteract
      the influence of harmful papal Bulls, and to prevent the interference
      of Italian ecclesiastics in the affairs of the Spanish Church. In the
      end of the fifteenth century the Spanish Bishops had been reduced to
      a state of dependence on the Crown; all exercise of ecclesiastical
      authority was carefully watched; the extent of ecclesiastical jurisdiction
      was specifically limited, and clerical courts were made to feel their
      dependence on the secular tribunals. The Crown wrung from the Papacy
      the right to see that piety and a zeal for religion were to be indispensable
      qualifications for clerical promotion. All this regulative zeal was
      preserved from being simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg
      490]</a></span> the attempts of politicians to control a rival power
      by certain fundamental elements in the national religious character,
      which expressed themselves in rulers as well as in the mass of their
      subjects. In Spain, more than in any other land, asceticism and mystical
      raptures were recognised to be the truest expression of genuine religious
      sentiment. Kings and commonalty alike shared in the firm belief that
      a real imitation of Christ meant to follow in the footsteps of the
      Man of Sorrows, who wandered about not knowing where to lay His head,
      and who was enabled to endure what was given Him to do and to suffer
      by continuous and rapt communion with the Unseen.</p>
<p>The ecclesiastical Reformer of Spain had all these elements to work upon,
      and they made his task comparatively easy.</p>
<h3>&sect; 2. <i>Reformation under Ximenes.</i></h3>
<p>The consolidation of the Peninsula under Ferdinand and Isabella suggested
      a thorough reorganisation of the Spanish Church. The Crown extorted
      from the Papacy extraordinary powers to deal with the secular clergy
      and with the monasteries. The great Queen was determined to purge the
      Church of her realm of all that she deemed to be evil. She called to
      her councils three famous Churchmen in whom she had thorough confidence&mdash;the
      great Spanish Cardinal, Mendoza, her confessor, Hernando de Talavera,
      and Francesco Ximenes. It was Ximenes who sketched the plan and who
      carried through the reformation.</p>
<p>Francesco Ximenes de Cisneros, as he is called, had been a Franciscan
      monk devoted to the ideals of his order. He belonged to a poor family,
      and had somehow or other attracted the attention of Cardinal Mendoza,
      at whose instigation the Queen had made him her father-confessor (1492).
      She insisted on his accepting the dignity of Archbishop of Toledo (1495),
      and had selected him to carry out her plans for the organisation and
      purification of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg
      491]</a></span> the Spanish Church. After his elevation to the arch-episcopal
      chair he gave the example of what he believed to be the true clerical
      life by following in the most literal way the maxims of St. Francis
      about self-denial, devotion, and ascetic life. He made these the ideal
      for the Spanish clergy; they followed where he led.</p>
<p>The Concordat of 1482 gave the Spanish Crown the right of &ldquo;visitation&rdquo; (held
      to involve the power to dismiss from office) and of nomination to benefices.
      Ximenes used these powers to the full. He &ldquo;visited&rdquo; the monasteries
      personally, and received full reports about the condition of the convents.
      He re-established in all of them monastic discipline of the strictest
      kind. The secular clergy were put to like proof. The secular power
      was invoked to sweep all opponents to reform from his path. His Queen
      protected him when the vacillations of the papal policy threatened
      to hinder his work. In the end, the Church in Spain secured a devoted
      clergy whose personal life was free from the reproaches justly levelled
      at the higher clergy of other lands.</p>
<p>Ximenes, having purified the morals of the Spanish clergy, next set himself
      to overcome their ignorance and lack of culture. In every Chapter within
      Castile and Aragon, two prebends were set apart for scholars, one of
      them for a student in Canon Law, and the other for an expert theologian.
      A special &ldquo;visitation&rdquo; of the clergy removed from their places all
      utterly ignorant persons. New schools of theology were instituted.
      In addition to the medi&aelig;val Universities of Salamanca and Valladolid,
      Ximenes founded one in Alcala, another in Seville, a third at Toledo.
      Alcala and Valladolid were the principal theological schools, and there,
      in addition to the older studies of Dogmatic Theology and Ethics, courses
      of lectures wore given in Biblical Exegesis. The theology taught was
      that of Thomas Aquinas, to the exclusion of the later developments
      of Scholastic under John Duns Scotus and William of Occam. The Augustinian
      elements in Thomas were specially dwelt upon; and soon there arose
      a school of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg
      492]</a></span> theologians who were called the New Thomists, who became
      very powerful, and were later the leading opponents of the Jesuit teachers.
      There was also an attempt to make use of the New Learning in the interest
      of the old theology. Ximenes collected at Alcala the band of scholars
      who under his superintendence prepared the celebrated Complutensian
      Polyglot.</p>
<p>The labours of Erasmus were sympathised with by the leaders of this Spanish
      movement. The Princes of the Church delighted to call themselves his
      friends. They prevented the Spanish monks from attacking him even when
      he struck hardest at the follies of the monastic life. He was esteemed
      at Court. The most prominent statesmen who surrounded Charles, the
      young Prince of the Netherlands, the King of Spain, called themselves
      Erasmians. Erasmus, if we are to believe what he wrote to them,&mdash;
      which is scarcely possible,&mdash;declared that the work in Spain under
      Ximenes followed the best type of a reformation in the Church.</p>
<p>But there was another and terrible side to this Spanish purification of
      the Church and of the clergy. The Inquisition had been reorganised,
      and every opinion and practice strange to the medi&aelig;val Church
      was relentlessly crushed out of existence. This stern repression was
      a very real part of the Spanish idea of a reformation.</p>
<p>The Spanish policy for the renovation of the Church was not a reformation
      in the sense of providing room for anything new in the religious experience.
      Its sole aim was to requicken religious life within the limits which
      had been laid down during the Middle Ages. The hierarchy was to remain,
      the medi&aelig;val conceptions of priesthood and sacraments; the Pope
      was to continue to be the acknowledged and revered Head of the Church; &ldquo;the
      sacred ceremonies, decrees, ordinances, and sacred usages&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> were
      to be left untouched; the dogmatic theology of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg
      493]</a></span> medi&aelig;val Church was to remain in all essentials
      the same as before. The only novelty, the only sign of appreciation
      of new ideas which were in the air, was that the papal interference
      in the affairs of national Churches was greatly limited, and that at
      a time when the Papacy had become so thoroughly secularised as to forget
      its real duties as a spiritual authority. The sole recognition of the
      new era, with its new modes of thought, was the proposal that the secular
      authorities of the countries of Europe should undertake duties which
      the Papacy was plainly neglecting. Perhaps it might be added that the
      slight homage paid to the New Learning, the appreciation of the need
      of an exact text of the original Scriptures, its guarded approval of
      the laity&rsquo;s acquaintance with Holy Writ, introduced something of the
      new spirit; but these things did not really imply anything at variance
      with what a devoted adherent of the medi&aelig;val Church might readily
      acquiesce in.</p>
<h3>&sect; 3. <i>The Spaniards and Luther.</i></h3>
<p>Devout Spaniards were able to appreciate much in Luther&rsquo;s earlier work.
      They could sympathise with his attack on Indulgences, provided they
      did not inquire too closely into the principles implied in the <i>Theses</i>&mdash;principles
      which Luther himself scarcely recognised till the Leipzig Disputation.
      Their hearts responded to the intense religious earnestness and high
      moral tone of his earlier writings. They could welcome his appearance,
      even when they could not wholly agree with all that he said, in the
      hope that his utterances would create an impetus towards the <i>kind</i> of
      reformation they desired to see. The reformation of the Spanish Church
      under Cardinal Ximenes enables us to understand both the almost universal
      welcome which greeted Luther&rsquo;s earlier appearances and the opposition
      which he afterwards encountered from many of his earlier supporters.
      Some light is also cast on that opposition when we remember that the
      Emperor Charles himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg
      494]</a></span> fully accepted the principles underlying the Spanish
      Reformation, and that they had been instilled into his youthful mind
      by his revered tutor whom he managed to seat in the chair of St. Peter&mdash;Adrian <span class="smcap">VI.</span>,
      whose short-lived pontificate was an attempt to force the Spanish Reformation
      on the whole of the Western Obedience.</p>
<p>If it be possible to accept the statements made by Glapion, the Emperor&rsquo;s
      confessor, to Dr. Br&uuml;ck, the Saxon Chancellor in the days before
      Luther&rsquo;s appearance at Worms, as a truthful account of the disposition
      and intentions of Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span>, it may be
      said that an attempt was made to see whether Luther himself might be
      made to act as a means of forcing the Spanish Reformation on the whole
      German Church. Glapion professed to speak for the Emperor as well as
      for himself. Luther&rsquo;s earlier writings, he said, had given him great
      pleasure; he believed him to be a &ldquo;plant of renown,&rdquo; able to produce
      splendid fruit for the Church. But the book on the <i>Babylonian Captivity</i> had
      shocked him; he did not believe it to be Luther&rsquo;s; it was not in his
      usual style; if Luther had written it, it must have been because he
      was momentarily indignant at the papal Bull, and as it was anonymous,
      it could easily be repudiated; or if not repudiated, it might be explained,
      and its sentences shown to be capable of a catholic interpretation.
      If this were done, and if Luther withdrew his violent writings against
      the Pope, there was no reason why an amicable arrangement should not
      be come to. The papal Bull could easily be got over, it could be withdrawn
      on the ground that Luther had never had a fair trial. It was a mistake
      to suppose that the Emperor was not keenly alive to the need for a
      Reformation of the Church; there were limits to his devotion to the
      Pope; the Emperor believed that he would deserve the wrath of God if
      he did not try to amend the deplorable condition of the Church of Christ.
      Such was Glapion&rsquo;s statement. It is a question how far he was sincere,
      and if so, whether he really did express what was in the mind of the
      Emperor. Frederick of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg
      495]</a></span> Saxony did not believe either in his sincerity or in
      his representation of the Emperor&rsquo;s real opinions; and Luther himself
      refused all private conference with Glapion. Yet it is almost certain
      that Glapion did express what many an earnest Spanish ecclesiastic
      thoroughly believed. We have an interesting confirmation of this in
      the conversation which Konrad Pellikan had with Francisco de los Angeles,
      the Provincial of the Spanish Franciscans at Basel. The Franciscan
      expressed himself in almost the very same terms as Glapion.<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a></p>
<p>Three forces met at the Diet of Worms in 1521&mdash;the German movement
      for Reform inspired by Luther, the Spanish Reformation represented
      by Charles v., and the stolid inertia of the Roman Curia speaking by
      the Nuncio Aleander. The first and the second could unite only if Luther
      retraced his steps and stood where he did before the Leipzig Disputation.
      If he refused, the inevitable result was that the Emperor and the Curia
      would combine to crush him before preparing to measure their strength
      against each other. The two different conceptions of reform may be
      distinguished from each other by saying that the Spanish conception
      sought to awaken the benumbed and formalist medi&aelig;val Church to
      a new religious life, leaving unchanged its characteristics of a sacerdotal
      ministry, an external visible unity under a hierarchy culminating in
      the Papacy, and a body of doctrine guaranteed by the decisions of &#338;cumenical
      Councils. The other wished to free the human spirit from the fetters
      of merely ecclesiastical authority, and to requicken the life of the
      Church through the spiritual priesthood of all believers. The former
      sought the aid of the secular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg
      496]</a></span> power to purge national Churches and restore ecclesiastical
      discipline, but always under a decorous air of submission to the Bishop
      of Rome, and with a very real belief in the supremacy and infallibility
      of a General Council. The latter was prepared to deny the authority
      of the Bishop of Rome altogether, and to see the Church of the Middle
      Ages broken up into territorial or National Churches, each of which,
      it was contended, was a portion of the one Visible Catholic Church.
      But as separate tendencies may be represented by a single contrast,
      it may be said that Charles would have forgiven Luther much had the
      Reformer been able to acknowledge the infallibility of a General Council.
      The dramatic wave of the hand by which Charles ended the altercation
      between Official Eck and Luther, when the latter insisted that General
      Councils had erred, and that he could prove it, ended the dream that
      the movement in Germany could be used to aid in the universal introduction
      of the Spanish Reformation. If the ideas of reforming Spanish ecclesiastics
      and statesmen were to requicken the whole medi&aelig;val Church, some
      other way of forcing their acceptance had to be found.</p>
<h3>&sect; 4. <i>Pope Adrian <span class="smcap">VI.</span> and the Spanish
            Reformation.</i></h3>
<p>The opportunity seemed to come when, owing to the rivalries of powerful
      Cardinals and the steady pressure of Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span> on
      the Conclave, Adrian of Utrecht was elected Pope. The new Pontiff had
      a long reputation for learning and piety. His courage had been manifested
      in his fearless denunciation of prevailing clerical abuses, and in
      the way he had dealt with difficult questions in medi&aelig;val theology.
      He had no sympathy with the new curialist ideas of papal inerrancy
      and infallibility, nor with the repeated assertions of Italian canonists
      that the Pope was superior to all ecclesiastical law. He rather believed
      that such ideas were responsible for the degradation of the Church,
      and that no amendment was possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg
      497]</a></span> until the whole system of papal reservations, exemptions,
      and other ways in which the Papacy had evaded the plain declarations
      of Canon Law, was swept away. The public confidence in his piety, integrity,
      and learning was so great that the Netherlands had entrusted him with
      the religious education of their young Prince, and none of his instructors
      so stamped themselves on the mind of Charles.</p>
<p>Adrian was a Dutch Ximenes. He had the same passionate desire for the
      Reformation of the Church, and the same ideas of how such Reformation
      could be brought about. He prized the ascetic life; he longed to see
      the monastic orders and the secular clergy disciplined in the strictest
      way; he had a profound admiration for Thomas Aquinas, and especially
      for that side of the great Schoolman&rsquo;s teaching which represented the
      ideas of St. Augustine. He so exactly reproduced in his own aspirations
      the desires of the Spanish Reformers, that Cardinal Carvajal, who with
      the grave enthusiasm of his nation was engaged in the quixotic task
      of commending the Spanish Reformation to the authorities in Rome, desired
      to take him there as an indispensable assistant. He was also in full
      sympathy with the darker side of the Spanish Reformation. During his
      sojourn in Spain he had become one of the heads of the Inquisition,
      and was firmly opposed to any relaxation of the rigours of the Holy
      Office. With Adrian in the chair of St. Peter, the Emperor and the
      leaders of the Spanish Church might hope to see their type of a reformation
      adopted to cure the ills under which the Church was suffering.</p>
<p>The new Pope did not lack sympathisers in Italy when he began his task
      of cleansing the Augean stables without turning the torrent of revolution
      through them. Cardinal Carvajal welcomed him in a speech which expressed
      his own ideas if it displeased his colleagues in whose name he was
      supposed to speak. A memorial drafted by Egidio, General of the Augustinian
      Eremites, was presented to him, which practically embodied the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg
      498]</a></span> reforms the new Pope wished to see accomplished.<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> His
      programme was as extensive as it was thorough. A large part of it may
      be compared with the reforms sketched in Luther&rsquo;s <i>Address to the
      Nobility of the German Nation</i>. He disapproved of the way in which <i>prebends</i> were
      taken from foundations within national Churches to swell the incomes
      of Roman Cardinals. He disliked the whole system of papal <i>reservations</i>, <i>indults,</i><a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> <i>exemptions</i>, <i>expectances</i>,
      which under the fostering care of Pope John <span class="smcap">XXII.</span> had
      converted the Curia into a great machine for raking in money from every
      corner of western Europe.<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> He
      disapproved of the system of encouraging complainants to pass over
      the episcopal courts of their own lands and bring their cases at once
      before the papal court. But every one of these reforms would cut off
      a source of revenue. It meant that hundreds of hungry Italian Humanists
      would lose their pensions, and that as many pens would lampoon the
      Holy Father who was intent on taking bread from his children. It meant
      that hundreds of ecclesiastical lawyers who had invested their savings
      in purchasing places in the Curia, would find themselves reduced to
      penury. It meant that the incomes of the Princes of the Church would
      shrink in an incalculable manner. Adrian set himself to show such men
      how to meet the changes in prospect. He brought his old Flemish peasant
      housekeeper with him to Rome, contented himself with the simple dishes
      she cooked for him, and lived the life of an anchorite in a corner
      of his vast palace on the Vatican hill; but in this case example did
      not seem better than precept. It had seemed so easy to the simple-minded
      Dutch scholar to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg
      499]</a></span> reform the Church; everything was provided for in the
      Canon Law, whose regulations had only to be put in force. His Spanish
      experience had confirmed him in the possibility of the task. But at
      Rome he found a system of Rules of Chancery which could not be set
      aside all at once; there was no convenient Inquisition so organised
      that it could clear all objectors out of his path; no secular power
      always ready to support a reforming Churchman.</p>
<p>Where was he to begin? The whole practice of Indulgences appeared to be
      what was most in need of reform. Its abuses had kindled the storm in
      Germany. To purge them away would show how much in earnest he was.
      He knew the subject well. He had written upon it, and therefore had
      studied it from all sides. Rightly understood, Indulgences were precious
      things. They showed how a merciful God had empowered His Church to
      declare that He pardoned sins freely; and, besides, they proclaimed,
      as no other usage of the Church did, the brotherhood of all believers,
      within which the stronger could help the weaker, and the holier the
      more sinful, and all could fulfil the law of Christ by bearing each
      other&rsquo;s burdens. Only it was to be remembered that every pardon required
      a heart unfeignedly penitent, and the sordid taint of money must be
      got rid of. But&mdash;there was always a
      &ldquo;but&rdquo; for poor Adrian&mdash;it was shown to him that the papal court
      could not possibly pay its way without the money which came in so easily
      from the sale of Indulgences. He was baffled at the very start; checks,
      for the most part quite unexpected, thwarted every effort. He was like
      a man in a nightmare, set in a thicket of thorns, where no hewing could
      set him free, clothes torn, limbs bleeding, till at last he sank exhausted,
      welcoming the death which freed him from his impossible task. Adrian
      was the distinguished martyr of the Spanish Reformation. History has
      dwelt upon his failures; they were only too manifest. It has derided
      his simplicity in sending Chieregati to Germany with the confession
      that the Curia was the source of most of the evils which beset the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg
      500]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg
      501]</a></span> medi&aelig;val Church, and at the same time demanding
      the death of Luther, who had been the first to show the fact in such
      a way that all men could see it. It has said little of the success
      that came in due time. Chieregati was unable to overcome the deeply
      rooted Evangelical Reformation in Germany. But his mission and the
      honest statement that the Curia was the seat of evil in the Church,
      date the beginnings of a reaction, of a genuine Romanist party with
      a vague idea of reforms on medi&aelig;val lines. It must be taken as
      the starting-point of the Counter-Reformation in Germany. Adrian&rsquo;s
      example, too, did much to encourage the few spiritually minded Churchmen
      in Italy, and its effects can be seen in the revival of a zeal to purify
      the Church which arose during the pontificate of Paul <span class="smcap">III.</span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3>ITALIAN LIBERAL ROMAN CATHOLICS AND THEIR CONCEPTION OF A REFORMATION.<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a></h3>
<h3>&sect; 1. <i>The Religious Condition of Italy.</i></h3>
<p>Italy is the land which next to Spain is the most important for the Counter-Reformation.
      While we can trace in Spain and in Germany a certain solidarity of
      religious movement, the spiritual conditions of Italy during the first
      half of the sixteenth century were as manifold as its political conditions.
      It is impossible to speak of the Italians as a whole. Italy had been
      the land of the Renaissance, but that great intellectual movement had
      never rooted itself deeply in the people as it had done in Germany,
      France, or England.</p>
<p>The Italian peasantry were a class apart from the burghers as they were
      nowhere else. Their religion was usually a thinly veiled paganism,
      a belief in the omnipresence of spirits, good and bad, to be thanked,
      propitiated, coaxed or compelled by use of charms, amulets, spells,
      and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span> ceremonies.
      The gods of their pagan ancestors had been replaced by local saints,
      and received the same kind of worship. To fight for their faith had
      never been a tradition with them as with the Spaniards; they were not
      troubled by any continuous sense of sin as were the people of the northern
      nations; but they had an intense fear of the supernatural, and their
      faith in the priest, who could stand between them and the terrors of
      the unseen, was boundless. Goodness touched them as it does all men.
      But the immorality of their religious guides did not embarrass them;
      a bad priest had as powerful spells as a good one. The only kind of
      Christianity which seemed able to impress them and hold them was that
      of Francis of Assisi. He was the highest embodiment of the Christian
      spirit for the Italian peasantry; the impression he had made upon the
      people of the Peninsula was enduring; the wandering revivalist preacher
      who lived as Francis had done always made the deepest impression. John
      of Capistrano owed much of his power to the fact that he remained always
      the Abruzzi peasant. During the whole of the period of the Renaissance
      the peasantry and the clergy who served the village chapels were regarded
      by those above them with a scorn that degenerated into hatred. We may
      search in vain through the whole of the literature of the time for
      the thought that any attempt ought to be made to lead them to a deeper
      faith and a purer life. The whole of the peasant population of Italy
      were believed to be beneath the level of desire for something better
      than what the religious life of the times gave.<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a></p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></p>
<p>The towns presented an entirely different picture. There was a solidarity
      binding together all the civic population. The ordinary division of
      ranks, made by greater or less possession of wealth or by social standing,
      existed, but it did not prevent a common mode of thinking. We can trace
      the same thoughts among artisans, small shopkeepers, rich merchants,
      and the patricians of the towns. No country presented so many varieties
      of local character as Italy; but the inhabitants of Venice or Florence,
      Milan, Naples, however else they might differ, were all on the same
      spiritual level. They thought much about religion; they took the moral
      degradation of the Church and of the clergy to heart; they longed to
      see some improvement, if it was only within their own city. They were
      clearsighted enough to trace the mischief to the influence of the Roman
      Curia, and their belief in the hopelessness of reforming the evil Court
      gives a settled despondency to their thought which appears in most
      of the Chronicles. The external side of religion was inextricably interwoven
      with their city life. The civic rulers had always something to do with
      the churches, monasteries, and other ecclesiastical foundations within
      their walls. They had no great interest in doctrine; what they wanted
      was a real improvement in the moral living of clergy and of people.
      When an Italian town was blessed with a good and pious Bishop, it is
      touching to see how the whole population rallied round him.</p>
<p>When we turn to the outstanding men of the Italian peninsula, whose opinions
      have been preserved in their writings or correspondence, we find, to
      begin with, a great variety of religious opinions whose common note
      is unconstrained hostility to the Church as it was then constituted.
      The institution was a necessary evil, very important as a factor in
      the game of politics, useless for the religious life. This sentiment
      existed almost universally, both among those who merely maintained
      a decorous relation towards the existing ecclesiastical institutions,
      and among those who really believed in Christianity, and acknowledged
      its power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg
      504]</a></span> over their mind and life. The papal Curia oppressed
      them; they were hopeless of its reformation, and yet there was little
      hope of a revival of religion, with its social worship and its &ldquo;sacraments&rdquo; unless
      it was reformed. The feeling of hopelessness is everywhere apparent;
      the deepest spiritual longings and experiences were to be treasured
      as sacred secrets of the heart, and not to be spoken about. Yet the
      work of Savonarola had not been entirely consumed in the fire that
      burnt the martyr, and the earlier message of Luther had found an echo
      in many Italian hearts.</p>
<h3>&sect; 2. <i>The Italian Roman Catholic Reformers.</i></h3>
<p>There is no evidence of any widespread acceptance of the whole of Luther&rsquo;s
      teaching, little appreciation of the thought that the Church may be
      conceived as a fellowship of God with man depending on the inscrutable
      purpose of God and independent of all visible outward organisation,
      none of the idea that the Visible Church Catholic exists one and indivisible
      in the many forms in which men combine to listen to the Word and to
      manifest their faith. The Catholic Church was always to these pious
      Italians the great historical and external institution with its hierarchy,
      and its visible head in the Bishop of Rome. A reform of the Church
      meant for them the reformation of that institution. So long as this
      was denied them they could always worship within the sanctuary of their
      own souls, and they could enjoy the converse of likeminded friends.
      So there came into existence coteries of pious Italians who met to
      encourage each other, and to plan the restoration of religion within
      the Church. Humanism had left its mark on all of them, and their reunions
      were called academies, after the Platonic academies of the earlier
      Renaissance. The first had come into being before the death of Leo. <span class="smcap">X.</span>&mdash;a
      society of pious laymen and prelates, who met in the little church
      of Santi Silvestro et Dorotea in the Trastevere in Rome. The associates
      were more than fifty in number, and they were all distinguished by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg
      505]</a></span> their love of the New Learning, the strict purity of
      their lives, and their devotion to the theology of St. Augustine. The
      members were scattered after the sack of Rome (1527), but this <i>Oratory
      of Divine Love</i> gave rise to many kindred associations within which
      the original members found a congenial society.</p>
<p>The most important found a home in Venice. Its most prominent members
      were Gasparo Contarini, a distinguished Senator, who afterwards was
      induced to become a Cardinal. With him were Cardinal Caraffa, already
      meditating upon taking another path, and Gregorio Cortese, then Abbot
      of San Giorgio Maggiore. The friends met in the beautiful garden of
      the convent. All shades of opinion were represented in this circle,
      where Humanists and Churchmen met to exchange views about a reformation
      of the Church. To share in such intercourse, Reginald Pole willingly
      spent his days far from his native England. Cardinal Fregoso, Archbishop
      of Salerno, gathered a similar company around him at Genoa; and Ghiberti,
      Bishop of Verona, collected likeminded friends to talk about the possibilities
      of reformation. Modena and Padua had their Christian academies also.
      Nor must the influence of well-born, cultured and pious ladies be forgotten.</p>
<p>Ren&eacute;e, Duchess of Ferrara and daughter of Louis <span class="smcap">XII.</span> of
      France, had accepted the Reformation in its entirety, and had surrendered
      herself to the guidance of Calvin. She corresponded with the great
      Frenchman and with Bullinger. She sheltered persecuted Italian Protestants,
      or had them safely conveyed to Switzerland.<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> But
      she saw good wherever it was to be found. Her letters, instinct with
      Christian graciousness, remind the reader of those of her kinswoman
      Marguerite of Navarre. She was full of sympathy with the circle of
      men and women who longed for a regeneration of Italy; and it is interesting
      to notice how the far more highly gifted Vittoria Colonna leant on
      the woman whose spiritual insight was deeper, and whose heart was purified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg
      506]</a></span> by the trials which her decision in religious matters
      made her pass through.</p>
<p>Caterina Cyb&oacute;, a niece of Pope Clement, Princess of Camerino, Eleonora
      Gonzaga, Duchess of Urbino, Julia Gonzaga at Naples, and Vittoria Colonna
      at Viterbo and at Rome, formed a circle of highly intellectual and
      deeply pious women, who by their letters and intercourse inspired men
      who were working for the regeneration of the Church in Italy.</p>
<p>The network of their correspondence covered Italy from Venice to Naples
      and from Genoa to Camerino, and the letters exchanged between Marguerite
      of Navarre and Vittoria Colonna extended the influence of the association
      beyond the peninsula. The correspondents, men and women, regarded themselves
      as a band of companions pledged to each other to work together for
      the Reformation of the Church and of society. It is not easy to describe
      their aims, for they contented themselves for the most part with vague
      aspirations; and they all had their favourite likes and dislikes. It
      is impossible to doubt their earnestness, but it was of the high-bred
      placid kind. It had nothing of the Spanish exaltation of Teresa, of
      the German vehemence of Luther, of the French passion scarcely veiled
      by the logical precision of Calvin. They all admired St. Francis, but
      in a way out of sympathy with the common people, for they looked on
      asceticism with a mild wonder, and had no eagerness for <i>that</i> type
      of the imitation of Christ. Vittoria Colonna indeed found the convent
      at Viterbo a pleasant retreat for a few weeks at a time. A sigh sometimes
      escaped her that perhaps the nuns were all Marys who had chosen the
      better part, but that was only when she was weary with the perversities
      of the incomprehensible world. Their correspondence suggests an academy
      of the earlier Italian Renaissance, where the theory of Ideas had given
      way to doctrines of Justification, and the Epistles of St. Paul had
      taken the place of the Dialogues of Plato. There is a touch of dilettantism
      in their habits of thought, and a savour of the eighteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg
      507]</a></span> century Salon in their intercourse. They longed to
      mediate between contending parties in the religious strife which was
      convulsing Europe beyond the Alps and might invade Italy; but they
      were unfit for the task. A true <i>via media</i> can only be found
      by men who see both sides of the controversy in the clear vision of
      thought, not by men who perceive neither distinctly. Sadoleto, to take
      one example, declared that he could see much to admire in the German
      Reformation, but what he approved were only the external portions which
      came from Humanism, not those elements which made the movement a religious
      revival. He disliked Luther, but had a great esteem for Bucer and Melanchthon.
      Indeed, the Italian Cardinal may be called the Melanchthon of Romanism.
      Melanchthon, rooted in Protestantism, felt compelled by his intellectual
      sympathy and humility to believe that there was some good in Romanism
      and to try to find it; Sadoleto, rooted in Romanism, was impelled to
      some sympathy with the Protestant theology. He had, however, a fatal
      lack of precision of thought. One doctrine tended to slide insensibly
      into another, into its opposite even, under the touch of his analysis.
      The man who could defend and commend auricular confession because it
      was an example of Christian humility, and saint-worship because it
      was a testimony to the immortality of the soul, ran the risk of being
      regarded as a trifler by Protestants and a traitor by Romanists. Such
      was his fate.</p>
<p>Contemporary with these offshoots from the <i>Oratory of Divine Love</i> was
      a revival among some of the monastic orders in Italy which had distinct
      connection with some of the members of the associations above mentioned.</p>
<p>The most important for its influence on the religious life of the people
      was the Order of the Capucins. It took its rise from Matteo de Grassis,
      a man of no intellectual powers, but endowed with more than the usual
      obstinacy of the Italian peasant. He was an Umbrian, like Francis himself.
      He belonged to a district where traditions of the great medi&aelig;val
      revivalist had been handed down from parents to children for generations,
      and one of these insisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg
      508]</a></span> that St. Francis had worn a hood with its peak pointed
      and not rounded, as the fashion among the monks then was. He declared
      that St. Francis had appeared to him in a vision, and had said that
      the brethren of the order ought to obey his rules &ldquo;to the letter, to
      the letter, to the letter.&rdquo; He for one resolved to obey. He threw away
      rounded hood and wore one with pointed peak. The peasants refused to
      recognise the novelty, and drove him off with stones; his brethren
      argued with him, and belaboured him with their fists; but Matteo stuck
      to his pointed hood. The shape was nothing, but the Founder&rsquo;s commands
      were everything; Matteo would die before he would wear the rounded
      thing which had never been hallowed by St. Francis. The Princess Caterina
      Cyb&oacute; took compassion on the hunted man, and gave him an asylum
      within her little principality of Camerino, where he wore his pointed <i>capuze</i> in
      peace. He soon sank back into the obscurity from which he had for a
      moment emerged. But new life was stirring among the Franciscans. Many
      were dissatisfied with the laxity of the order, and were longing for
      a monastic Reformation. All down the Middle Ages the watchword of every
      monastic revival had been, &ldquo;Back to the Founder&rsquo;s rules.&rdquo; The pointed
      hood was a trifle, but it was the symbol of a return to the rigid discipline
      of Francis. Men heard that Camerino was an asylum for Franciscans discontented
      with the laxity of the superiors of the order, and gradually they flocked
      to the little principality. Vittoria Colonna had long mourned over
      the decadence of the genuine monastic life; she encouraged her friend
      the Princess Caterina to beseech her uncle the Pope to permit the pointed
      hood, and gradually there came into being a new fresh offshoot of the
      Franciscans, called the Capucins, who revived the traditions of St.
      Francis, and went preaching among the villages after the fashion of
      his earlier followers. Francis had told his disciples to beware of
      books when making their sermons; he had advised them to talk to the
      women as they washed, Italian fashion, by the side of streams, to masons
      while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span> they
      were hewing, to artisans at their work, to find out what their religious
      difficulties were, what prevented them becoming really Christians in
      their lives, and then to discourse on the things they had heard. This
      old Franciscan preaching was restored by the Capucins, and they did
      more than any others to bring the people of Italy back to the discredited
      Church. They were accused of heresy. What &ldquo;reformation&rdquo; of the Franciscans
      was not? They were called Lutherans; and a good deal of Luther&rsquo;s Evangelical
      teaching was unconsciously presented in their sermons; but they could
      always quote St. Francis for what they said; and who could gainsay
      what Francis had taught?</p>
<p>This monastic revival affected the commonalty; another spoke to the educated
      classes. As early as 1504 an attempt had been made to reorganise the
      great Benedictine order, and a number of Benedictine abbeys had united
      to form a Congregation, which soon after its institution took the name
      of the Benedictine Mother-Cloister, Monte Cassino. Gregorio Cortese,
      one of the members of the <i>Oratory of Divine Love</i>, entered into
      the movement, and as Abbot of the Benedictine convent on the Island
      of Lerina on the Riviera, and afterwards in the convent of San Giorgio
      Maggiore at Venice, led his monks to show that their convents were
      the centres of learning dedicated to the service of the Church. He
      interested himself more especially in historical studies with a view
      of maintaining the historic traditions of the Church, which were beginning
      to be shaken by historical criticism, then in its infancy.</p>
<p>The improvement of the secular clergy was more important for the Church
      in Italy than any reforms of the monastic orders. An attempt to do
      this was begun by two members of the <i>Oratory of Divine Love</i>,
      Giovanni Pietro Caraffa and Gaetano da Thiene. Their idea was that
      in every diocese there ought to be a small band of men doing the work
      of secular clergy but bound by monastic vows. Their idea was taken
      from Augustine&rsquo;s practice of living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg
      510]</a></span> monastically with some of his clergy; and fulfilled
      itself in the order of the Theatines. The name was derived from Theate
      (Chieti), the small See of which Caraffa was Bishop. These picked clergy
      were to be to the Bishop what his staff is to a general. The Theatines
      were not to be numerous, still less to include the whole secular clergy
      of a diocese; but they were to incite by precept, and above all by
      example, to a truly clerical life. The idea spread, and similar associations
      arose all over Italy.<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a></p>
<p>Such were the preparations in Italy for the Counter-Reformation. There
      was no prospect of any attempt to set the Church in order while Pope
      Clement <span class="smcap">VII.</span> lived. He exhausted all his
      energies in preventing the summoning of a General Council&mdash;a measure
      on which Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span> was growing more and
      more set as the only means of ending the religious dispute in Germany.</p>
<p>The accession of Paul <span class="smcap">III.</span> (1534) seemed to
      inaugurate a new era full of hopes for the advocates of reform at the
      centre of the Roman Church. The new Pope made Gasparo Contarini, Caraffa,
      Sadoleto, and Pole Cardinals. A Bull, which remained unpublished, was
      read in the Consistory (January 1536), sketching the possibility of
      reforming the Curia. The Pope appointed a commission of nine members
      to report upon the needful reforms, and the commission was everywhere
      regarded as a sort of preliminary Council, a body of men who were appointed
      to investigate and tabulate a programme of necessary reforms to be
      laid before a General Council. The Commissioners were Contarini, Caraffa,
      Ghiberti, Sadoleto, Pole, Fregoso, all of whom had been members of
      the <i>Oratory of Divine Love</i>, Aleander who had been Nuncio at
      the Diet of Worms, and Tomaso Badia, Master of the Sacred Palace. They
      met and drafted a report which was presented to the Pope in 1537, and
      is known as the <i>Consilium delectorum cardinalium et aliorum pr&aelig;latorum
      de emendanda ecclesia</i>. A more scathing indictment of the condition
      of the Roman Church could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg
      511]</a></span> scarcely be imagined, nor one which spoke more urgently
      of the need of radical reformation. Its very thoroughness was disconcerting.
      It revealed so many scandals connected with the Papacy that it was
      resolved not to make it known. But it had been printed as a private
      document; a copy somehow or other reached Germany; it was at once republished
      there, with comments showing how a papal commission itself had justified
      all the German demands for a reformation of the Church. At Rome the
      appearance of reforming activity was maintained. Contarini, Caraffa,
      Aleander, and Badia were appointed to investigate the workings of those
      departments of the Curia which had most to do with the abuses detailed
      in the report of the Commission of Nine&mdash;the <i>Chancery</i>,
      the <i>Datary</i>, and the <i>Penitentiary</i>, where reservations,
      dispensations, exemptions, etc., were given and registered. They presented
      their report in the autumn of 1537. It was entitled <i>Consilium quattuor
      delectorum a Paulo <span class="smcap">III.</span> super reformatione
      sanct&aelig;
      Roman&aelig; Ecclesi&aelig;</i>. But Contarini evidently felt that
      the Pope needed pressing. When the Commission of Nine had been appointed,
      the Pope had summoned a General Council to meet at Mantua in May 1537,
      in a Bull published on May 29th, 1536, and had also published a Bull
      of Reformation in September of that year. The Council never met&mdash;the
      war between Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span> and Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span> preventing.
      The Council was then summoned to meet at Vicenza, but was again postponed.
      The Emperor had no wish for a General Council in Italy, and the Pope
      was determined not to call one to meet in Germany. In these circumstances
      Contarini published his <i>Epistola de potestate Pontificis in usu
      clavium</i>, and his <i>De potestate Pontificis in Compositionibus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a></p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></p>
<p>Historians differ about the sincerity of Pope Paul <span class="smcap">III.</span> in
      the matter of reform, and there is room for two opinions. His Italian
      policy was anti-Hapsburg, and the German Romanist Princes, at all events,
      had little belief in his sincerity, and were seriously meditating on
      following the example of Henry <span class="smcap">VIII.</span> Cardinal
      Morone, the Nuncio in Germany, made no concealment of the difficulties
      attending the position of the Romanist Church there, and urged continually
      substantial reforms in Italy, and the necessity of a General Council.
      Perhaps these energetic messages stirred the Pope to renewed activity
      in Rome, and also to the necessity of formulating a definite policy
      with regard to the Lutherans beyond the Alps. In April (1540) commissions
      were appointed to reform certain offices in the Curia&mdash;the Rota,
      the Chancery, and the Penitentiary. Consultations were held about how
      to deal with the state of affairs in Germany. For the moment the ideas
      of the more liberal-minded Italian Reformers were in the ascendant.
      Charles had determined to find out whether it was not possible to reunite
      the broken Church in Germany. Conferences were to be held with the
      leading Lutheran theologians. The Pope determined to reject the advice
      of Faber, the Bishop of Vienna, and to refrain from pronouncing judgment
      on a series of Lutheran propositions sent to him for condemnation.
      Cardinal Contarini, whose presence had been urgently required by the
      Emperor, was permitted to cross the Alps to see, in conference with
      distinguished Lutherans, whether some common terms of agreement might
      be arrived at which would serve as a programme to be set before the
      General Council, which all were agreed must be summoned sometime soon.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></p>
<h3>&sect;3. <i>Cardinals Contarini and Caraffa.</i></h3>
<p>This mission of Contarini&rsquo;s to Germany dates the separation between two
      different ways of proposing to deal with the Reformation movement.
      The two methods were embodied in two men, Cardinals Contarini and Caraffa.
      They had both belonged to the <i>Oratory of Divine Love</i>; they were
      both zealous to see the Church reformed in the sense of reviving its
      moral and spiritual life; they both longed to see the rent which had
      made itself apparent repaired, and the Church again reunited. They
      differed entirely about the means to be adopted to bring about the
      desirable end. The differences originated in the separate characters
      and training of the two leaders.</p>
<p>Gasparo Contarini belonged to an ancient patrician family of Venice, and
      spent the greater portion of his life in the service of the Republic.
      He was looked on as the ablest and most upright of its statesmen. He
      had drunk deeply of the well of the New Learning, and yet can hardly
      be called a Humanist. He had been a student at Padua, and had there
      studied and learned to appreciate Scholastic Theology. He had been
      trained as a Venetian statesman, and clung to the political ideas of
      the medi&aelig;val jurisprudence. The whole round of medi&aelig;val
      thought encircled and possessed him. Christendom was one great commonwealth,
      and embodied three great imperialist ideas&mdash;a world King, the
      Emperor; a world priest, the Pope; a realm of sanctified science, the
      Scholastic Philosophy under Theology, the Queen of the Sciences. He
      held these three conceptions in a broad-minded and liberal way. There
      was room under the Emperor for a community of Christian States, under
      the Pope for a brotherhood of national Churches, under Scholastic for
      the New Learning and what it brought to enrich the mind of mankind.</p>
<p>Erasmus had ridiculed Scholastic; Contarini&rsquo;s friend Cortese called it
      a farrago of words; Luther had maintained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg
      514]</a></span> that it sounded hollow because at its centre was the
      vague eternal Something of Pagan Philosophy and not the Father who
      had revealed His heart in Jesus Christ; but Contarini saw the grandeur
      of the imposing edifice, believed in its solidity, and would do nothing
      to destroy it. But this did not prevent him sympathising strongly with
      Luther&rsquo;s doctrine of Justification by Faith, nor from believing that
      room might be found for it and other Protestant conceptions within
      the circle of medieval theological thought. He had little sympathy
      with the enthusiasm which some of his friends&mdash;Cardinal Pole for
      example&mdash;expressed for Plato. Aristotle was for him the great
      master-builder of human systematic thinking; but the Aristotle he recognised
      as the Master was not the sage revealed in the Greek text or commentaries
      (although he studied both), but the Aristotle who had cast his spell
      over Thomas Aquinas and Albertus Magnus. He was firmly persuaded that
      the Bishop of Rome was the Head of the Church, and as such had his
      place in the political system of Christendom from which he could not
      be removed without serious danger to the whole existing framework of
      society; but he looked on the Pope as a constitutional monarch bound
      to observe in his own person the ecclesiastical laws imposed by his
      authority on the Christian world. Luther, he believed, had recognised
      this in his earlier writings, and in this recognition lay the possibilities
      of a readjustment which would bring Christendom together again. On
      the other hand, Calvin&rsquo;s <i>Institutio</i> filled him with mingled
      admiration and dread. He recognised it to be the ablest book which
      the Protestant movement had produced; but the thought of a Christian
      democracy with which it was permeated, the stress it laid on the procession
      of the divine purpose down through the ages, and the manner in which
      it taught the prevenience of divine grace, were conceptions whose acceptance,
      he thought, would be dangerous to the political governance of mankind.</p>
<p>He dwelt with complacency on the thought that he had never longed for
      ecclesiastical place or power. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg
      515]</a></span> Pope had persuaded him to permit himself to be made
      Cardinal because the Holy See had need of his service. He was conscious
      with a sort of proud humility that he was generally esteemed the foremost
      Italian of his generation, that enthusiastic friends spoke of his learning
      and virtue as &ldquo;more divine than human.&rdquo; He thought much more of his
      position as a Venetian Senator and the trusted counsellor of the Republic,
      whose constitution he believed to be the embodiment of the best political
      principles of the time, than he did of his place in the Roman Court. &ldquo;I
      for my part, to tell the truth, do not think that the Red Hat is my
      highest honour,&rdquo; he was accustomed to say. Such was the leader of the
      liberal-minded Roman Catholics of Italy, who was asked by the Pope
      and urgently entreated by the Emperor to visit Germany and end the
      schism by his persuasions.</p>
<p>Giovanni Picture&rsquo;s Caraffa, the intimate, the rival and the supplanter
      of Contarini, belonged to one of the oldest noble families of Naples.
      His house was intimately allied to the Church, and for more than one
      hundred years its members had been Archbishops of Naples, and several
      had been made Cardinals. The boy was destined for the Church. As a
      child he had longed to enter a cloister, and had once set out to join
      the Dominicans. His family, however, had other views for him. He was
      sent when eighteen years of age to the papal court, and was soon almost
      burdened with marks of distinction and with offices. He had been highly
      educated while at Naples, and had steeped himself in the New Learning.
      At the Humanist Courts of Alexander <span class="smcap">VI.</span> and
      Julius <span class="smcap">II.</span> he studied Greek and Hebrew,
      and became an accomplished theologian besides. In 1504, much against
      his will, he had been consecrated Bishop of the small diocese of Chieti
      (Theate), lying in the wild Abruzzi district, almost due east of Rome,
      on the slopes from the highest spurs of the Apennines to the Adriatic.
      He found his people demoralised by constant feuds, and the priests
      worse than their parishioners. Caraffa, determined to reduce his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg
      516]</a></span> unruly diocese to order, began with persuasion; and
      finding this of small avail, flogged people and clergy into something
      like decency by repeated spiritual censures and rigidly enforced excommunications.
      His methods revealed the man. His talents were of too high an order
      and his family influence too great to permit him to linger in his uncivilised
      diocese. He was sent as Nuncio to England and thence to Spain. His
      visit to the latter country made an indelible impression on his strong
      nature. His earnest petitions for the independence of his native Naples
      were contemptuously refused by the young King Charles, and the fierce
      Neapolitan pursued the Emperor with an undying hatred. But what was
      more important, his stay in Spain imbued him with the ideas of the
      Spanish Reformation. He was too much an Italian and too strong a believer
      in the papal supremacy to adopt the thought of secular interference
      in the affairs of the Church, but with that exception the Spanish method
      of renovating the Church took possession of him heart and soul. The
      germs of fanaticism, hitherto sleeping within him, were awakened to
      life, and never afterwards slumbered. He sympathised with the projects
      of Adrian <span class="smcap">VI.</span>, and was a power during his
      brief pontificate. During the reign of Clement <span class="smcap">VII.</span> he
      took little part in public affairs, but all the attempts to put new
      life into the monastic orders were assisted by him. He viewed with
      some suspicion the attempt to conciliate the Germans; and the results
      of Contarini&rsquo;s dealing with the Protestants at Regensburg filled him
      with alarm.</p>
<p>Contarini&rsquo;s attempt to reunite the Church by reconciliation was twenty
      years too late. It is doubtful whether anyone in Germany save the Emperor
      had much faith in the uniting influences of a conference. Morone, who
      had for years represented the Vatican at the Court of Ferdinand of
      Austria, and who was perpetually urging the Pope to summon a General
      Council, was afraid ever since Hagenau that conferences benefited the
      Protestants more than the Romanists. Contarini himself had said that
      what was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg
      517]</a></span> needed to overcome the German movement was neither
      conferences nor discussions about doctrine, but a Reformation in morals.
      The Curia regarded his mission as a dangerous experiment. They tied
      his hands as firmly as they could by his letter of instructions: He
      was to inform the Emperor that no Legate, not even the Pope himself
      until he had consulted the other nations, could modify the doctrines
      of the Church for the sake of the Germans; he was to do his utmost
      to prevent the assembly of a National Council for Germany. He heard
      from Paris that the French Romanists believed that he was about to
      betray the Church to the heretics. No one encouraged him except his
      own circle of immediate friends. The men with whom he was to work,
      Cardinal de Granvelle and Dr. Eck, were suspicious of him and of his
      antecedents. Nevertheless his natural and confirmed optimism urged
      him to the task.</p>
<p>The situation, looked at broadly and from the point of view taken by a
      contemporary who had made himself acquainted with the theology and
      constitution of the medi&aelig;val Church, was not so hopeless as it
      must seem to us with the history of what followed to enlighten us.
      The great mass of medi&aelig;val doctrines lay uncodified. They were
      not codified until the Council of Trent. The extreme claims made by
      the supporters of a papal absolutism&mdash;claims which may be briefly
      expressed by the sentence: The Church Universal is condensed in the
      Roman Church, and the Roman Church is represented by the Pope&mdash;which
      had been used to crush the Lutheran movement in its earliest stages,
      were of recent origin. Curialism could be represented to be almost
      as much opposed to the medi&aelig;val theory of the Church as anything
      that Luther had brought forward. There was a real <i>via media</i>,
      if it could only be discovered and defined. The commonplace opinions
      of men who were sincerely attached to the medi&aelig;val conception
      of the Church, with its claims to catholicity, with its doctrines,
      usages, ceremonies and hierarchy, could scarcely be better represented
      than in the declaration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg
      518]</a></span> said to have been made by Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span> to
      his sister Maria, his governor in the Netherlands:</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;It happened that on the Vigil of St. John the Baptist the Emperor
            held a banquet in the garden. Now, when Queen Maria asked him
            what he thought of doing with the people and with the Confession
            (the Augsburg) that had been presented, he made reply: &lsquo;Dear
            Sister, when I was made chief of the Holy Roman Empire, the great
            complaint reached me that the people who profess this doctrine
            were more wicked than the devil. But the Bishop of Seville gave
            me the advice that I should not think of acting tyrannically,
            but should ascertain whether the doctrine is at variance with
            the articles of the Christian faith (the Apostles&rsquo; Creed). This
            advice pleased me, and so I find that the people are not so devilish
            as had been represented; nor is the subject of dispute the Twelve
            Articles, but a matter lying outside them, which I have therefore
            handed over to the scholars. If their doctrine had been in conflict
            with the Twelve Articles I should have been disposed to apply
            the edge of the sword.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Twelve Articles, as the Apostles&rsquo; Creed was called, always occupied
      a peculiar position in the Western Church. They were believed to contain
      the <i>whole</i> of the <i>theologia revelata</i>. The great Schoolmen
      of the most opposite parties (Thomas Aquinas and John Duns Scotus alike)
      were accustomed to deduce from the Apostles&rsquo; Creed fourteen propositions,
      seven on God and seven on the Incarnation, and to declare that they
      contained the sum of revealed theology; everything else was natural
      theology on which men might differ without being considered to have
      abandoned the essentials of the Christian faith. Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span> had
      been taught at first, probably by Aleander&rsquo;s insistent reiterations,
      that Luther had denied some portion of this revealed theology; he had
      come to learn that he had been wrongly informed; therefore conference
      and adjustment were possible.</p>
<p>Men like Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span> and Contarini could honestly
      believe that so far as doctrine was concerned a compromise might be
      effected.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></p>
<h3>&sect; 4. <i>The Conference at Regensburg.</i></h3>
<p>The Diet was opened at Regensburg in February 1541. The Emperor explained
      his position and intentions. He declared that the most important duty
      before them was to try to heal the division in religion which was separating
      Germany into two opposing parties. The one duty of the hour was to
      endeavour to come to a unanimous decision on religious matters, and
      to bring about this he proposed to name some peace-loving men who could
      confer together upon the points in debate. Count Frederick of the Palatinate,
      brother of the Elector, and Cardinal de Granvelle were nominated presidents:
      three pronounced Protestants, two pronounced Romanists, and one whose
      opinions were doubtful, were the assessors; Eck, Gropper, and Pflug
      were to support the Romanist side, Melanchthon, Bucer, and Pistorius
      were the speakers for the Protestants. Perhaps the only name that could
      be objected to was that of Eck; it was impossible to think of him as
      a man of peace. The Legate Contarini guided everything.</p>
<p>During preliminary conferences an understanding was come to on some practical
      questions which served to preserve an appearance of unanimity. It was
      thought that marriage might be permitted to the clergy and the cup
      to the laity within Germany; that the Pope might be honoured as the
      Primate of the Church, provided it was clearly understood that his
      position did not give him the power of perpetual interference in the
      affairs of the national Churches; that the hierarchy might be maintained
      if the episcopal jurisdiction were exercised conjointly by a vicar
      appointed by the Bishop and a learned layman appointed by the secular
      authority.</p>
<p>It was the business of the conference to discuss the deeper theological
      differences which were supposed to separate the two parties. So in
      the opening meetings the delegates began to consider those questions
      which gathered round the thought of Justification.</p>
<p>It was agreed that there was no distinction between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg
                  520]</a></span> the ordinances of grace and those of nature
                  in the original condition of man. This declaration involved
                  the denial of the distinction between the <i>dona supernaturalia</i> and
                  the <i>dona naturalia</i> made so much of in Scholastic
                  Theology, and the basis of a great deal of its Pelagian
                  tendencies. It was expressly conceded by the Romanist theologians
                  that man had lost his original freedom of will by the Fall&mdash;a
                  concession directly at variance with the future declaration
                  of the Council of Trent.<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> The
                  statement agreed upon about the origin of sin was given
                  almost in the words of the Augsburg Confession, and agrees
                  with them. The doctrine of the tenacity of original sin
                  scarcely differs from a statement of Luther&rsquo;s which had
                  been condemned in the Bull <i>Exurge Domine</i> of Pope
                  Leo <span class="smcap">X.</span><a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> In
                  the discussions and conclusions about this first head of
                  doctrine the conclusions of Protestant theology had been
                  amply vindicated.</p>
<p>There was more difficulty on the matter of Justification. Two definitions
      suggested by the Romanist theologians and by Melanchthon were successively
      rejected, and one brought forward, it is said by Contarini himself,
      was accepted after some discussion. It was couched in language which
      the Lutheran theologians had not been accustomed to use. It embodied
      phrases which Pole, Contarini, and other liberal Italian Roman Catholics
      had made their own. The Protestants of Germany, however, saw nothing
      in it to contradict their cherished ideas upon Justification, and they
      gladly accepted the definition. The statement, repeated more than once,
      that grace is the free gift of God and is not merited by our works,
      expressed their deepest thought, and completely excluded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg
      521]</a></span> meritorious character of ecclesiastical good works.
      They seemed rather pleased than otherwise that their thoughts could
      be expressed in language suggested by Romanist theologians.<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a> It
      appears that Eck, while consenting to the definition, wished to avoid
      signing it, but was compelled by Granvelle to fix his name to the document.<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a></p>
<p>The fact that the Romanist and Protestant members of the conference could
      agree upon an article on Justification caused great rejoicings among
      Contarini&rsquo;s friends in Italy. Cardinal Pole was convinced that every
      obstacle in the way of reunion had been removed, and the most extravagant
      expectations were cherished.<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> The
      Protestant members of the conference were entirely satisfied with the
      results so far as they had gone.</p>
<p>The conference then turned to questions affecting the organisation and
      worship of the Church.</p>
<p>Somewhat to their surprise, the Protestants found that their opponents
      were willing to accept their general theory of what was meant by the
      Church and what were its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>
distinguishing characteristics. The Christian Society was defined without
      any reference to the Pope as its permanent Head on earth. This provoked
      strong dissents from Rome when the definition was known there. Differences
      emerged when the power of the Church was discussed, and as there was
      no prospect of agreement it was resolved for the meanwhile to omit
      the article.<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a></p>
<p>The question of the Sacrament of the Holy Supper evoked differences which
      were felt to be almost insuperable. It was inevitable. For here the
      one fundamental divergence between the new Evangelical faith and medi&aelig;val
      religion came to practical expression. Nothing could reconcile the
      Evangelical thought of a spiritual priesthood of all believers with
      the belief in a mediating priesthood who could give and could withhold
      God. Doctrines might be stated in terms which hid this fundamental
      difference; a definition of Justification by Faith alone might be conceded
      to the Protestants; but any thought of a priestly miracle in the Sacrament
      of the Holy Supper had to be repudiated by the one party and clung
      to by the other.</p>
<p>At first things went smoothly enough; it was conceded that special ways
      of dispensing the Sacraments were matters indifferent, but whenever
      the question of Transubstantiation emerged, things came to a deadlock.
      It was perhaps characteristic of Contarini&rsquo;s somewhat surface way of
      dealing with the whole question at stake between the two parties, that
      he never probed the deeper question. He rested his plea for Transubstantiation
      on the ground that an important article of faith which had been assented
      to for so long must not be questioned.<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> The
      Protestants held a private conference, at which all the theologians
      present were asked to give their opinions in turn. There Calvin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span>
spoke, dwelling on the thought that Transubstantiation implied adoration,
      which could never be conceded. His firmness produced unanimity. Melanchthon
      drafted their common opinion, which was given in writing to Granvelle,
      who refused in strong language to accept it, and the conference came
      to an end. The more difficult practical subjects of the sacrificial
      character of the Mass and of private Masses were not discussed.<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a></p>
<p>This conference at Regensburg may almost be said to be the parting of
      the ways. Up to 1525 the movement under Luther had the appearance of
      a Reformation of the whole Church in Germany. From 1525 to the date
      of this conference there was always the expectation that the Lutherans
      who had formed territorial Churches might yet be included in a general
      Reformation of the whole German Church. Joachim <span class="smcap">II.</span> of
      Brandenburg cherished the idea long after 1541; and Charles v. still
      believed that what could not be effected by mutual compromise might
      be done by a mediating creed imposed upon all by the authority of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg
      524]</a></span> the Emperor. But compromise failed at Ratisbon, and
      there was no further hope of its succeeding.</p>
<p>The decisive character of the Regensburg conference was seen in Italy
      almost at once. Its failure involved the destruction of the party of
      Italian Romanists who hoped to end the religious strife by a compromise.
      When Contarini returned to Italy he found that his influence was gone.
      He was rewarded with the Government of Bologna, which removed him from
      the centre of things. He died soon after (Aug. 24th, 1542), leaving
      none behind him to fill his place. Ghiberti survived him only sixteen
      months. Caraffa had become more and more alienated from his early friends.
      Sadoleto, Pole, and Morone remained, all of them men of intellect,
      but lacking the qualities which fit men to be leaders in trying times.
      Pole lived to make atonement for his liberalism by hounding on the
      persecutions in England, and Morone by becoming the champion of ultramontanism
      at the close of the Council of Trent. The conception of a Catholic
      Reformation disappeared; the idea of a Counter-Reformation took its
      place.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h3>IGNATIUS LOYOLA AND THE COMPANY OF JESUS.<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a></h3>
<h3>&sect; 1. <i>At Manresa.</i></h3>
<p>The little mountainous province of Guipuzcoa, lying at the corner of the
      Bay of Biscay, bordering on France, was the district of Spain which
      produced one of the greatest of her sons, I&ntilde;igo de Recalde de
      Loyola, the founder of the Society of Jesus. The tower which was the
      family seat still stands, rough and windowless as a Scottish border
      keep, adorned with one ornament only, a stone above the doorway, on
      which are carved the arms of the family&mdash;two wolves in quest of
      prey. Guipuzcoa had never been conquered by the Moors, and its nobles,
      poor in their barren highlands, boasted that the bluest Gothic blood
      ran in their veins. The Recaldes belonged to the very oldest nobility
      of the district, and possessed the highly valued privilege of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg
      526]</a></span> right of personal summons to the coronation of the
      Kings of Leon. Their younger sons were welcomed at Court as pages,
      and then as soldiers; and the young I&ntilde;igo was a page at the
      Court of Ferdinand. He was well educated for a Spanish noble; could
      read and write; composed ballads; and could illuminate manuscripts
      with miniatures. Most of his spare time was employed in reading those
      romances of chivalry then very popular. When older he became a soldier
      like his elder brothers.</p>
<p>In 1521, when twenty-eight years of age (b. 1493), he was the youngest
      officer in command of the garrison of Pampeluna, ordered to withstand
      a combined force of invading French troops and some revolting Spaniards.
      The enemy appeared before the place in such overwhelming numbers that
      all but the youngest officer wished to surrender without a struggle.
      I&ntilde;igo&rsquo;s eloquence persuaded the garrison to attempt a desperate
      defence. No priest was among the soldiers; the Spaniards, according
      to their custom, confessed each other, and were ready to die at their
      posts. A bullet struck the young officer as he stood in the breach
      encouraging his men. His fall gave the victory to the besiegers.</p>
<p>The conspicuous bravery of I&ntilde;igo had won the respect of his enemies.
      They extricated him from the heap of dead under which he was buried,
      and conveyed him to the old family castle. There his shattered leg
      was so badly set as to unfit him for a soldier&rsquo;s career. He had it
      twice broken and twice reset. The prolonged torture was useless; he
      had to believe that he would never fight on horseback again. The dream
      of taking a man&rsquo;s part in the conquests which all Spaniards of that
      age believed lay before their country, had to be abandoned. His body
      was a useless log.</p>
<p>But I&ntilde;igo was a noble of the Basque provinces, and possessed, in
      a superlative degree it was to be discovered, the characteristics of
      his race&mdash;at once taciturn and enthusiastic, wildly imaginative,
      and sternly practical. He has himself recorded that, as soon as he
      was convinced that he could never become a distinguished soldier, he
      asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span> himself
      whether he might not become a famous saint like Dominic or Francis,
      and that the question arose from no spiritual promptings, but simply
      from the determination to win fame before his death. As he lay bedridden,
      thinking much and dreaming more, it suddenly occurred to him that no
      one could become a saint unless he lived very near God, and that his
      life had not been of such a kind. He at once resolved that he would
      change; he would feed on herbs like a holy hermit; he would go to Jerusalem
      as a devout pilgrim. This vow, he tells us, was the earliest conscious
      movement of his soul towards God. His reward came soon in the shape
      of his first revelation. The blessed Virgin, with the Child Jesus in
      her arms, appeared to him in a dream. He awoke, hustled out of bed,
      dragged himself to the small window of his turret-room, and looked
      out. The earth was dark, an obscure mingling of black shadows; the
      heavens were a great vault of deepest blue strewn with innumerable
      stars. The sight was a parable and an inspiration. &ldquo;How dull earth
      is,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;how glorious heaven!&rdquo; He felt that he must <i>do</i> something
      to get nearer God. He must be alone in some holy place to think things
      out with his own soul. His brother&rsquo;s servants hoisted the maimed body
      of the once brilliant soldier on an ass, one foot in a boot, the wounded
      leg still swathed in bandages and its foot in a large soft slipper,
      and I&ntilde;igo left the old castle determined to live a hermit&rsquo;s
      life on Montserrat, the holy hill of Aragon.</p>
<p>There in the church of Our Lady of Montserrat he resolved to dedicate
      himself to her service with all the ceremonies prescribed in that masterbook
      of medi&aelig;val chivalry, Amadis of Gaul. He hung his arms on her
      altar, and throughout the long night, standing or kneeling, he kept
      his watch, consecrating his knightly service to the Blessed Virgin.
      At daybreak he donned an anchorite&rsquo;s dress, gave his knightly robes
      to the first beggar he met, and, mounted on his ass, betook himself
      to the Dominican convent of Manresa, no longer I&ntilde;igo Recalde
      de Loyola, but simply Ignatius.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></p>
<p>At Manresa he practised the strictest asceticism, hoping to become in
      heart and soul fitted for the saint life he wished to live. Then began
      a time of unexpected, sore and prolonged spiritual conflict, not unlike
      what Luther experienced in the Erfurt convent. Who was he and what
      had been his past life that he should presumptuously think that God
      would ever accept him and number him among His saints? He made unwearied
      use of all the medi&aelig;val means of grace; he exhausted the resources
      of the confessional; he consulted one spiritual guide after another
      without experiencing any relief to the doubts which were gnawing at
      his soul. The whole machinery of the Church helped him as little as
      it had Luther: it could not give peace of conscience. He has placed
      on record that the only real help he received during this prolonged
      period of mental agony came from an old woman. Confession, instead
      of soothing him, rather plunged him into a sea of intolerable doubt.
      To make his penitence thorough, to know himself as he really was, he
      wrote out his confession that he might see his sins staring at him
      from the written page. He fasted till his life was in danger; he prayed
      seven times and scourged himself thrice daily, but found no peace.
      He tells us that he often shrieked aloud to God, crying that He must
      Himself help him, for no creature could bring him comfort. No task
      would be too great for him, he exclaimed, if he could only see God.
      &ldquo;Show me, O Lord, where I can find Thee; I will follow like a dog,
      if I can only learn the way of salvation.&rdquo; His anguish prompted him
      to suicide. More than once, he says, he opened his window with the
      intention of casting himself down headlong and ending his life then
      and there; but the fear of his sins and their consequences restrained
      him. He had read of a saint who had vowed to fast until he had been
      vouchsafed the Beatific Vision, so he communicated at the altar and
      fasted for a whole week; but all ended in vanity and vexation of spirit.</p>
<p>Then, with the sudden certainty of a revelation, he resolved to throw
      himself on the mercy of God, whose long-suffering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg
      529]</a></span> pity would pardon his sins. This was the crisis. Peace
      came at last, and his new spiritual life began. He thought no longer
      about his past; he no longer mentioned former sins in his confessions;
      the certainty of pardon had begun a new life within him; he could start
      afresh. It is impossible to read his statements without being struck
      with the similarity between the spiritual experience of Ignatius and
      what Luther calls Justification by Faith; the words used by the two
      great religious leaders were different, but the experience of pardon
      won by throwing one&rsquo;s self upon the mercy of God was the same.</p>
<p>This new spiritual life was, as in Luther&rsquo;s case, one of overflowing gladness.
      Meditation and introspection, once a source of anguish, became the
      spring of overpowering joy. Ignatius felt that he was making progress. &ldquo;God,&rdquo; he
      says, &ldquo;dealt with me as a teacher with a scholar; I cannot doubt that
      He had always been with me.&rdquo; Many historical critics from Ranke downwards
      have been struck with the likeness of the experience gone through by
      Luther and Ignatius. One great contrast manifested itself at once.
      The humble-minded and quiet German, when the new life awoke in him,
      set himself unostentatiously to do the common tasks which daily life
      brought; the fiery and ambitious Spaniard at once tried to conquer
      all mysteries, to take them by assault as if they were a beleaguered
      fortress.</p>
<p>He had his visions as before, but they were no longer temptations of Satan,
      the source of doubt and torture. He believed that he could actually
      see with bodily eyes divine mysteries which the intelligence could
      not comprehend. After lengthened prayer, every faculty concentrated
      in one prolonged gaze, he felt assured that he could <i>see</i> the
      mystery of Transubstantiation actually taking place. At the supreme
      moment he saw Christ in the form of a white ray pass into the consecrated
      bread and transform it into the Divine Victim (Host). He declared that
      in moods of exaltation the most impenetrable mysteries of theology,
      the Incarnation of our Lord, the Holy Trinity, the personality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg
      530]</a></span> of Satan, were translated into visible symbols which
      made them plainly understood. These visions so fascinated him, that
      he began to write them down in simple fashion for his own satisfaction
      and edification.</p>
<p>In all this the student of the religious life of Spain during the sixteenth
      century will recognise the mystical devotion which was then characteristic
      of the people of the Peninsula. The Spanish character, whether we study
      it in the romances of chivalry which the land produced, or in the writing
      of her religious guides, was impregnated by enthusiasm. It was passionate,
      exalted, entirely penetrated and possessed by the emotion which for
      the time dominated it. In no country were the national and religious
      sentiment so thoroughly fused and united. The long wars with the Moors,
      and their successful issue in the conquest of Grenada, had made religion
      and patriotism one and the same thing. Priests invariably accompanied
      troops on the march, and went into battle with them. St. James of Compostella
      was believed to traverse the country to bring continual succour to
      the soldiers who charged the Moors invoking his name. A victory was
      celebrated by a solemn procession in honour of God and of the Virgin,
      who had delivered the enemy into the hands of the faithful. This intensity
      of the Spanish character, this temperament distinguished by force rather
      than moderation, easily gave birth to superstition and burning devotion,
      and both furnished a fruitful soil for the extravagances of Mysticism,
      which affected every class in society. Statesmen like Ximenes, no less
      than the common people, were influenced by the exhortations or predictions
      of the <i>Beat&aelig;</i>,&mdash;women who had devoted themselves to
      a religious life without formally entering into a convent,&mdash;and
      changed their policy in consequence. It was universally believed that
      such devotees, men and women, could be illuminated divinely, and could
      attain to a state of familiar intercourse with God, if not to an actual
      union with Him, by giving themselves to prayer, by abstinence from
      all worldly thoughts and actions, and by practising the most rigid
      asceticism. It was held that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg
      531]</a></span> those who had attained to this state of mystical union
      received in dreams, trances, and ecstasies, visions of the divine mysteries.</p>
<p>The heads of the Spanish Inquisition viewed this Mysticism, so characteristic
      of the Peninsula, with grave anxiety. The thought that ardent believers
      could by any personal process attain direct intercourse, even union
      with God, apart from the ordinary machinery of the Church, cut at the
      roots of the medi&aelig;val penitential system, which always presupposed
      that a priestly mediation was required. If God can be met in the silence
      of the believer&rsquo;s soul, where is the need for the priest, who, according
      to medi&aelig;val ideas, must always stand between the penitent and
      God, and by his action take the hand of faith and lay it in the hand
      of the divine omnipotence? Other dangers appeared. The Mystic professed
      to draw his knowledge of divine things directly from the same source
      as the Church, and his revelations had the same authority. It is true
      that most of the Spanish Mystics, like St. Teresa, had humility enough
      to place themselves under ecclesiastical direction, but this was not
      the case with all. Some prophets and prophetesses declared themselves
      to be independent, and these <i>illuminati</i>, as they were called,
      spread disaffection and heresy. Hence the attitude of the Inquisition
      towards Mystics of all kinds was one of suspicious watchfulness. St.
      Teresa, St. Juan de la Cruz, Ignatius himself, were all objects of
      distrust, and did not win ecclesiastical approbation until after long
      series of tribulations.</p>
<p>It is necessary to insist on the fact that Ignatius had a deeply rooted
      connection with the Spanish Mystics. His visions, his methods, the <i>Spiritual
      Exercises</i> themselves, cannot be understood apart from their intimate
      relations to that Mysticism which was characteristic of the religion
      of his land and of his age.</p>
<p>Ignatius was no ordinary Mystic, however. What seemed the whole or the
      end to Teresa or Osuna was to him only a part, or the means to something
      better. While<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg
      532]</a></span> he received and rejoiced in the visions vouchsafed
      to him, he practised the keenest introspection. He observed and analysed
      the moods and states of mind in which the visions came most readily
      or the reverse, and made a note of them all. He noted the postures
      and gestures of the body which helped or hindered the reception of
      visions or profitable meditation on what had been revealed. He saw
      that he could reproduce or at least facilitate the return of his visions
      by training and mastering his mind and body, and by subjecting them
      to a spiritual drill which might be compared with the exercises used
      to train a soldier in the art of war. Out of these visions, introspections,
      comparisons, experiments experienced in solitude at Manresa, came by
      long process of gradual growth and elaboration the famous <i>Spiritual
      Exercises</i>, which may be called the soul of the Counter-Reformation,
      as Luther&rsquo;s book on <i>The Liberty of the Christian Man</i> contains
      the essence of Protestantism.</p>
<p>Ignatius spent nearly a year at Manresa. He had accomplished his object&mdash;to
      find himself at peace with God. It remained to fulfil his vow of pilgrimage.
      He laid aside his hermit&rsquo;s garb, and with it his ascetic practices;
      but he believed it to be his duty to renounce all property and live
      absolutely poor. He left all the money he possessed upon a bench and
      walked to Barcelona, supporting himself by begging. There he was given
      a passage to Venice, and thence he sailed for the Holy Land. His enthusiasm,
      and above all his project for beginning a mission among the Turks,
      alarmed the chief of the Franciscans in Jerusalem, who insisted on
      shipping him back to Italy. He reached Barcelona determined to pursue
      such studies as would enable him to know theology. He had never learned
      Latin, the gateway to all theological learning, and the man of thirty
      entered school, and seated himself on the bench with boys. Thence he
      went to Alcala and to Salamanca, and attended classes in these towns.
      Before he had quitted Manresa he had begun to speak to others about
      his visions, and to persuade them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg
      533]</a></span> submit themselves to the spiritual drill of his <i>Exercises</i>.
      Some ladies in Barcelona had become his devoted disciples. At Alcala
      and Salamanca he had tried to make converts to his system. The ecclesiastical
      authorities of the districts, fearing that this was a new kind of dangerous
      Mysticism, seized him, and he was twice incarcerated in the episcopal
      Inquisition. It would probably have fared ill with him had it not been
      for the intercession of some of the distinguished ladies who had been
      his disciples. His imprisonment in both cases was short, but he was
      forbidden to discriminate between mortal and venial sins (a thing essential
      if he acted as a spiritual director) until he had studied theology
      for four years.</p>
<h3>&sect; 2. <i>Ignatius at Paris.</i></h3>
<p>With prompt military obedience Ignatius decided to study at Paris. He
      reached the city in the beginning of 1528, driving an ass laden with
      his books and clothes. He went naturally to the College Montaigu, which
      under its Principal, No&euml;l B&eacute;da, was the most orthodox in
      Paris; but with his well known determination to see and judge everything
      for himself, he soon afterwards obtained leave to reside in the College
      Ste. Barbe, one of the most liberal, in which George Buchanan was then
      a Regent.<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a></p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></p>
<p>His sojourn in Paris could not fail to make a deep impression on the middle-aged
      Spaniard, consumed with zeal to maintain in its minutest details the
      old religion, and to destroy heresy and disobedience. Two passions
      possessed him, both eminently Spanish. He could say with St. Teresa
      that he suffered so much to see the Lutherans, whose baptism had rendered
      them members of the Church, lose themselves unhappily, that had he
      several lives he would willingly give them to deliver only one of them
      from the horrible torments which awaited them; but he also believed
      that it was for God a point of honour to avenge Himself on those who
      despised His word, and that it belonged to all the faithful to be instruments
      of the vengeance of the Almighty.</p>
<p>His keen practical nature grasped the religious situation in Paris (City
      and University), and suggested his lifework. He saw the strength of
      the Roman Catholic democracy face to face with the Reformation, and
      to what power it might grow if it were only organised and subjected
      to a more than military discipline. Ignatius was in Paris during the
      years when partisan feelings ran riot.</p>
<p>Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span> was by taste and training a man
      of the Renaissance. It pleased him to be called and to imagine himself
      to be the patron of men of letters. He was as devoted as his selfish,
      sensual nature permitted him to be, to his sister Marguerite d&rsquo;Angoul&ecirc;me,
      and for her sake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg
      535]</a></span> countenanced such Reformers as Lef&egrave;vre and the &ldquo;group
      of Meaux.&rdquo; He had a grudge against the Sorbonne and the <i>Parlement</i> of
      Paris for their attempts to baffle the Concordat of 1516; while he
      recognised the power which these two formidable associations possessed.
      He was an anti-Sorbonnist, who feared the Sorbonne (the great theological
      faculty of the University of Paris), and could not help displaying
      his dread. He had long dreamed of instituting a <i>Coll&eacute;ge de
      France</i>, a free association of learned teachers, men who could introduce
      the New Learning and form a counterpoise to the Sorbonne which dominated
      the University. The project took many forms, and never came to full
      fruition until long after the days of Francis; but the beginnings were
      sufficient to encourage Reformers and to irritate to fury the supporters
      of the Sorbonne. The theological faculty of the University was then
      ruled by No&euml;l B&eacute;da, a man of no great intellectual capacity,
      who hated everything which seemed to menace medi&aelig;valism. B&eacute;da,
      by his dogged courage, by his unflinching determination, by his intense
      conviction that he was in the right, was able to wage a pitiless warfare
      against the New Learning and every appearance of religious reform.
      He was able to thwart the King repeatedly, and more than once to attack
      him through Marguerite, his sister. His whole attitude and activity
      made him a forerunner of the Romanist League of two generations later,
      and, like the Leaguers, he based his power on organising the Romanist
      fanaticism lying in the populace of Paris and among the students of
      the Sorbonne. All this Loyola saw under his eyes during his stay in
      Paris. He heard the students of the Sorbonne singing their ferocious
      song:</p>
<div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza"> <span class="i0">&ldquo;Prions tons le Roi de gloire<br />
            </span> <span class="i1">Qu&rsquo;il confonde ces chiens mauldicts,<br />

      </span> </div>
</div>
<p>Amidst this seething crowd of warring students and teachers, Ignatius
      went, silent, watchful, observing everything. He cared little for theological
      speculation, being a true and typical Spaniard. The doctrines of the
      medi&aelig;val theology were simply military commands to his disciplined
      mind; things to be submitted to whether understood or not. Heresy was
      mutiny in the ranks. He had a marvellous natural capacity for penetrating
      the souls of others, and had cultivated and strengthened it by his
      habits of daily introspection and of writing down whatever, good or
      bad, passed through his own soul. It is told of him that in company
      he talked little, but quietly noted what others said, and that he had
      infinite genius for observing and storing details.<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> He
      sought to learn the conditions of life and thought outside Paris and
      France, and made journeys to the Low Countries and to England, saying
      little, thinking much, observing more. All the time he was winning
      the confidence of fellow-students, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg
      537]</a></span> taking infinite pains to do so&mdash;weighing and testing
      their character and gifts. He played billiards with some, paid the
      college expenses of others, and was slowly, patiently making his selection
      of the young men whom he thought fit to be the confidants of his plans
      for the regeneration of Christendom, and to be associates with him
      in the discipline which the <i>Exercises</i> gave to his own soul.<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a></p>
<p>He finally chose a little band of nine disciples&mdash;Peter Faber, Diego
      Lainez, Francis Xavier, Alonzo Salmeron, Nicholas Boabdilla, Simon
      Rodriguez, Paul Broet, Claude Jay, and Jean Codure. Codure died early.
      Faber, the first selected, was a Savoyard, the son of a poor peasant,
      with the unbending will and fervent spiritual imagination of a highlander.
      No one of the band was more devoted to his leader. Francis Xavier belonged,
      like Loyola himself, to an ancient Basque family; none was harder to
      win than this proud young Spaniard. Lainez and Salmeron were Castilians,
      who had been fellow-students with Ignatius at Alcala. Lainez had always
      been a prodigy of learning, &ldquo;a young man with the brain of an ancient
      sage.&rdquo; He, too, had been hard to win, for his was not a nature to kindle
      easily; but once subdued he was the most important member of the band.
      Salmeron, his early companion, was as impetuous and fiery as Lainez
      was cool and logical. He was the eloquent preacher of the company.
      Boabdilla, also a Spaniard, was a man of restless energy, who needed
      the strictest discipline to make him keep touch with his brothers.
      Rodriguez, a Portuguese, and Jay, from Geneva, were young men of insinuating
      manners, and were the destined diplomatists of the little company.
      Broet, a phlegmatic Netherlander among these fiery southerners, endeared
      himself to all of them by his sweet purity of soul.</p>
<p>Such were the men whom Ignatius gathered together on the Feast of the
      Ascension of Mary in 1534 in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg
      538]</a></span> Church of St. Mary of Montmartre, then outside the
      walls of Paris. There they vowed that if no insuperable difficulty
      prevented, they would go together to Palestine to work for the good
      of mankind. If this became impossible, they would ask the Pope to absolve
      them from their vow and betake themselves to whatever work for the
      good of souls His Holiness directed them to do. No Order was founded;
      no vows of poverty and obedience were taken; the young men were a band
      of students who looked on each other as brothers, and who promised
      to leave family and friends, and, &ldquo;without superfluous money,&rdquo; work
      together for a regeneration of the Church. Faber, already in priest&rsquo;s
      orders, celebrated Mass; the company dined together at St. Denys. Such
      was the quiet beginning of what grew to be the Society of Jesus.</p>
<p>The companions parted for a season to meet again at Venice.</p>
<h3>&sect; 3. <i>The Spiritual Exercises.</i></h3>
<p>All the nine associates had submitted themselves to the spiritual guidance
      of Ignatius, and had all been subjected to the training contained in
      the <i>Exercitia Spiritualia</i>. It is probable that this manual of
      military drill for the soul had not been perfected at the date of the
      meeting at Montmartre (1534), for we know that Loyola worked at it
      from 1522 on to 1548, when it was approved by Pope Paul <span class="smcap">III.</span>;
      but it may be well at this stage to give some account of this marvellous
      book, which was destined to have such important results for the Counter-Reformation.<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a></p>
<p>The thought that the spiritual senses and faculties might be strengthened
      and stimulated by the continuous repetition of a prescribed course
      of prayer and meditation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg
      539]</a></span> was not a new one. The German Mystics of the fourteenth
      century, to name no others, had put their converts through such a discipline,
      and the practice was not unusual among the Dominicans. It is most likely
      that a book of this kind, the <i>Exercitatorio dela vida spirital</i> of
      Garcia de Cisneros, Abbot of the Monastery of Montserrat (1500), had
      been studied by Ignatius while he was at Manresa. But this detracts
      nothing from the striking and unique originality of the <i>Exercitia
      Spiritualia</i>, they stand alone in plan, contents, and intended result.<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> They
      were the outcome of Loyola&rsquo;s protracted spiritual struggles, and of
      his cool introspection of his own soul during these months of doubt
      and anguish. Their evident intention is to guide the soul through the
      long series of experiences which Loyola had endured unaided, and to
      lead it to the peace which he had found.</p>
<p>It is universally admitted that Ignatius had always before him the conception
      of military drill. He wished to discipline the soul as the drill-sergeant
      moulds the body. The <i>Exercises</i> are not closet-rules for solitary
      believers seeking to rise to communion with God by a ladder of meditation.
      A guide was indispensable, <i>the Master of the Exercises</i>, who
      had himself conquered all the intricacies of the method, and who, besides,
      must have as intimate a knowledge as it was possible to acquire of
      the details of the spiritual strength and weakness of his pupil. It
      was the easier to have this knowledge, as the disciple must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg
      540]</a></span> more than half won before he is invited to pass through
      the drill. He must have submitted to one of the fathers in confession;
      he must be made to understand the absolute necessity of abandoning
      himself to the exercises with his whole heart and soul; he must promise
      absolute submission to the orders of the director; he must by frequent
      confession reveal the recesses of his soul, and describe the most trivial
      thoughts which flit through it; above all, he must enter on his prolonged
      task in a state of the liveliest expectation of the benefits to be
      derived from his faithful performance of the prescribed exercises.<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> A
      large, though strictly limited, discretion is permitted to the <i>Master
      of the Exercises</i> in the details of the training he insists upon.</p>
<p>The course of drill extends over four weeks<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> (twenty-five
      days). It includes prolonged and detailed meditations on four great
      subjects:&mdash;sin and conscience; the earthly Kingdom of Christ;
      the Passion of Jesus; and the Love of God with the Glory of the Risen
      Lord.<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> During
      all this time the pupil must live in absolute solitude. Neither sight
      nor sound from the world of life and action must be allowed to enter
      and disturb him. He is exhorted to purge his mind of every thought
      but the meditation on which he is engaged; to exert all his strength
      to make his introspection vivid and his converse with the Deity unimpeded.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></p>
<p>True meditation, according to Ignatius, ought to include four things&mdash;a
      preparatory prayer; <i>pr&aelig;ludia</i>, or the ways of attuning
      the mind and sense in order to bring methodically and vividly some
      past historical scene or embodiment of doctrine before the soul of
      the pupil; <i>puncta</i>, or definite heads of each meditation on which
      the thoughts are to be concentrated, and on which memory, intellect,
      and will are to be individually exercised; <i>colloquia</i>, or ecstatic
      converse with God, without which no meditation is supposed to be complete,
      and in which the pupil, having placed the crucifix before him, talks
      to God and hears His voice answering him.</p>
<p>When the soul&rsquo;s progress on the long spiritual journey in which it is
      led during these meditations is studied, one can scarcely fail to note
      the crass materialism which envelops it at every step. The pupil is
      required to <i>see</i> in the mirror of his imagination the boundless
      flames of hell, and souls encased in burning bodies; to <i>hear</i> the
      shrieks, howlings, and blasphemies; to <i>smell</i> the sulphur and
      intolerable stench; to <i>taste</i> the saltness of the tears, and
      to <i>feel</i> the scorching touch of the flames.<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> When
      the scene in the Garden of Gethsemane is the subject of meditation,
      he must have in the <i>camera obscura</i> of his imagination a garden,
      large or small, see its enclosing walls, gaze and gaze till he discerns
      where Christ is, where the Apostles sleep, perceive the drops of sweat,
      touch the clothes of our Lord.<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> When
      he thinks of the Nativity, he must conjure up the figures of Joseph,
      Mary, the Child, <i>and a maid-servant</i>, hear their homely family
      talk, see them going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg
      542]</a></span> about their ordinary work.<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> The
      same crass materialism envelops the meditations about doctrinal mysteries.
      Thinking upon the Incarnation is almost childishly limited to picturing
      the Three Persons of the Trinity contemplating the broad surface of
      the earth and men hurrying to destruction, then resolving that the
      Second is to descend to save; and to the interview between the angel
      Gabriel and the Virgin.<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a></p>
<p>A second characteristic of this scheme of meditation is the extremely
      limited extent of its sphere. The attention is confined to a few scenes
      in the life of our Lord and of the Virgin. No lessons from the Old
      Testament are admitted. All theological speculation is strictly excluded.
      What is aimed at is to produce an intense and concentrated impression
      which can never be effaced while life lasts. The soul is alternately
      torn by terror and soothed by the vision of heavenly delights. &ldquo;The
      designed effect was to produce a vivid and varied hypnotic dream of
      twenty-five days, from the influence of which a man should never wholly
      free himself.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a></p>
<p>The outstanding feature, however, of the <i>Exercises</i> and of the <i>Directory</i> is
      the minute knowledge they display of the bodily conditions and accompaniments
      of states of spiritual ecstasy, and the continuous, not to say unscrupulous,
      use they make of physical means to create spiritual abandon. They master
      the soul by manipulating the body. Not that self-examination, honest
      and careful recognition of sins and weaknesses in presence of temptation,
      have no place in the prolonged course of discipline. This is inculcated
      with instructions which serve to make it detailed, intense, almost
      scientific. The pupil is ordered to examine himself twice a day, in
      the afternoon and in the evening, and to make clear to himself every
      sin and failure that has marked his day&rsquo;s life. He is taught to enter
      them all, day by day, in a register, which will show him and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg
      543]</a></span> confessor his moral condition with arithmetical accuracy.
      But during his own period of spiritual struggle and depression at Manresa,
      Ignatius, in spite of the mental anguish which tore his soul, had been
      noting the bodily accompaniments of his spiritual states; and he pursued
      the same course of introspection when rejoicing in the later visions
      of God and of His grace. The <i>Exercises</i> and the <i>Directory</i> are
      full of minute directions about the physical conditions which Ignatius
      had found by experience to be the most suitable for the different subjects
      of meditation. The old Buddhist devotee was instructed to set himself
      in a spiritual trance by the simple hypnotic process of gazing at his
      own navel; the Ignatian directions are much more complex. The glare
      of day, the uncertainty of twilight, the darkness of night are all
      pressed into service; some subjects are to be pondered standing upright
      motionless, others while walking to and fro in the cell, when seated,
      when kneeling, when stretched prone on the floor; some ought to be
      meditated upon while the body is weak with fasting, others soon after
      meals; special hours, the morning, the evening, the middle of the night,
      are noted as the most profitable times for different meditations, and
      these vary with the age and sex of the disciple. Ignatius recognises
      the infinite variety that there is in man, and says expressly that
      general rules will not fit every case. The <i>Master of Exercises</i> is
      therefore enjoined to study the various idiosyncrasies of his patients,
      and vary his discipline to suit their mental and physical conditions.</p>
<p>It is due chiefly to this use of the conditions of the body acting upon
      the mind that Ignatius was able to promise to his followers that the
      ecstasies which had been hitherto the peculiar privilege of a few favoured
      saints should become theirs. The Reformation had made the world democratic;
      and the Counter-Reformation invited the mob to share the raptures and
      the visions of a St. Catherine or a St. Teresa.</p>
<p>The combination of a clear recognition of the fact that physical condition
      may account for much in so-called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg
      544]</a></span> spiritual moods with the use made of it to create or
      stimulate these moods, cannot fail to suggest questions. It is easy
      to understand the Mystic, who, ignorant of the mysterious ways in which
      the soul is acted upon by the body, may rejoice in ecstasies and trances
      which have been stimulated by sleepless nights and a prolonged course
      of fasting. It is not difficult to understand the man who, when he
      has been taught, casts aside with disdain all this juggling with the
      soul through the body. But it is hard to see how anyone who perceived
      with fatal clearness the working of the machinery should ever come
      to think that real piety could be created in such mechanical ways.
      To believe with some that the object Ignatius had was simply to enslave
      mankind, to conquer their souls as a great military leader might master
      their lives, is both impossible and intolerable. No one can read the
      correspondence of Loyola without seeing that the man was a devout and
      earnest-minded Christian, and that he longed to bring about a real
      moral reformation among his contemporaries. Perhaps the key to the
      difficulty is given when it is remembered that Ignatius never thought
      that the raptures and the terrors his course of exercises produced
      were an end in themselves, as did the earlier Mystics. They were only
      a means to what followed. Ignatius believed with heart and soul that
      the essence of all true religion was the blindest submission to what
      he called the &ldquo;true Spouse of Christ and our Holy Mother, which is
      the orthodox, catholic, and hierarchical Church.&rdquo; We have heard him
      during his time of anguish at Manresa exclaim, &ldquo;Show me, O Lord, where
      I can find Thee; I will follow like a dog, if I only learn the way
      of salvation!&rdquo; He fulfilled his vow to the letter. He never entered
      into the meaning of our Lord&rsquo;s saying, &ldquo;Henceforth I call you not servants
      ... but friends&rdquo;; he had no understanding of what St. Paul calls &ldquo;reasonable
      service&rdquo; (&#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#954;&#951; &#955;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#953;&#945;).
      The only obedience he knew was unreasoning submission, the obedience
      of a dog. His most imperative duty, he believed, lay in the resignation
      of his intelligence and will to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg
      545]</a></span> ecclesiastical guidance in blind obedience to the Church.
      It is sometimes forgotten how far Ignatius carried this. It is not
      that he lays upon all Christians the duty of upholding every portion
      of the medi&aelig;val creed, of medi&aelig;val customs, institutions,
      and superstitions; or that the philosophy of St. Thomas of Bonaventura,
      of the Master of the Sentences, and of &ldquo;other recent theologians,&rdquo; is
      to be held as authoritative as that of Holy Writ;<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> but &ldquo;if
      the Church pronounces a thing which seems to us white to be black,
      we must immediately say that it is black.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a> This
      was for him the end of all perfection; and he found no better instrument
      to produce it than the prolonged hypnotic trance which the <i>Exercises</i> caused.</p>
<h3>&sect; 4. <i>Ignatius in Italy.</i></h3>
<p>In the beginning of 1537 the ten associates found themselves together
      at Venice. A war between that Republic and the Turks made it difficult
      for them to think of embarking for Palestine; and they remained, finding
      solace in intercourse with men who were longing for a moral regeneration
      of the Church. Contarini did much for them; Vittoria Colonna had the
      greatest sympathy with their projects; Caraffa only looked at them
      coldly. The mind of Ignatius was then full of schemes for improving
      the moral tone of society and of the Church&mdash;daily prayer in the
      village churches, games of chance forbidden by law; priests&rsquo; concubines
      forbidden to dress as honest women did, etc.;&mdash;all of which things
      Contarini and Vittoria had at heart.</p>
<p>After a brief stay in Venice, Ignatius, Lainez, and Faber travelled to
      Rome, and were joined there by the others in Easter week (1538). No
      Pontiff was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[Pg
      546]</a></span> accessible as Paul <span class="smcap">III.</span>,
      and the three had an audience, in which they explained their missionary
      projects. But this journey through Italy had evidently given Ignatius
      and his companions new ideas. The pilgrimage to Palestine was definitely
      abandoned, the money which had been collected for the voyage was returned
      to the donors, and the associates took possession of a deserted convent
      near Vicenza to talk over their future. This conference may be called
      the second stage in the formation of the Order. They all agreed to
      adopt a few simple rules of life&mdash;they were to support themselves
      by begging; they were to go two by two, and one was always to act as
      the servant for the time being of the other; they were to lodge in
      public hospitals in order to be ready to care for the sick; and they
      pledged themselves that their chief work would be to preach to those
      who did not go to church, and to teach the young.</p>
<p>The Italian towns speedily saw in their midst a new kind of preachers,
      who had caught the habits of the well-known popular <i>improvisatori</i>.
      They stood on the kerb-stones at the corners of streets; they waved
      their hats; they called aloud to the passers-by. When a small crowd
      was gathered they began their sermons. They did not preach theology.
      They spoke of the simple commands of God set forth in the Ten Commandments,
      and insisted that all sins were followed by punishment here or hereafter.
      They set forth the prescriptions of the Church. They described the
      pains of hell and the joys of heaven. The crowds who gathered could
      only partially understand the quaint mixture of Italian and Spanish
      which they heard. But throughout the Middle Ages the Italian populace
      had always been easily affected by impassioned religious appeals, and
      the companions created something like a revival among the masses of
      the towns.</p>
<p>It was this experience which made Ignatius decide upon founding a <i>Company
            of Jesus</i>. It was the age of military companies in Italy,
            and the mind of Ignatius always responded to anything which suggested
            a soldier&rsquo;s life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[Pg
            547]</a></span> Other Orders might take the names of their founders;
            he resolved that his personality should be absorbed in that of
            his Crucified Lord. The thought of a new Order commended itself
            to his nine companions. They left their preaching, journeyed
            by various paths to Rome, each of them meditating on the Constitution
            which was to be drafted and presented to the Pope.</p>
<p>The associates speedily settled the outlines of their Constitution. Cardinal
      Contarini, ever the friend of Loyola, formally introduced them to the
      Pope. In audience, Ignatius explained his projects, presented the draft
      Constitution of the proposed new Order, showed how it was to be a militia
      vowed to perpetual warfare against all the enemies of the Papacy, and
      that one of the vows to be taken was: &ldquo;That the members will consecrate
      their lives to the continual service of Christ and of the Popes, will
      fight under the banner of the Cross, and will serve the Lord and the
      Roman Pontiff as God&rsquo;s Vicar upon earth, in such wise that they shall
      be bound to execute immediately and without hesitation or excuse all
      that the reigning Pontiff or his successors may enjoin upon them for
      the profit of souls or for the propagation of the faith, and shall
      do so in all provinces whithersoever he may send them, among Turks
      or any other infidels, to the farthest Ind, as well as in the region
      of heretics, schismatics, or unbelievers of any kind.&rdquo; Paul <span class="smcap">III.</span> was
      impressed with the support that the proposed Order would bring to the
      Papacy in its time of stress. He is reported to have said that he recognised
      the Spirit of God in the proposals laid before him, and he knew that
      the associates were popular all over Italy and among the people of
      Rome. But all such schemes had to be referred to a commission of three
      Cardinals to report before formal sanction could be given.</p>
<p>Then Loyola&rsquo;s troubles began. The astute politicians who guided the counsels
      of the Vatican were suspicious of the movement. They had no great liking
      for Spanish Mysticism organised as a fighting force; they disliked
      the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span> enormous
      powers to be placed in the hands of the General of the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;; they
      believed that the Church had suffered from the multiplication of Orders;
      eight months elapsed before all these difficulties were got rid of.
      Ignatius has placed on record that they were the hardest months in
      his life.</p>
<p>During their prolonged audience Paul <span class="smcap">III.</span> had
      recognised the splendid erudition of Lainez and Faber. He engaged them,
      and somewhat later Salmeron, as teachers of theology in the Roman University,
      where they won golden opinions. Ignatius meanwhile busied himself in
      perfecting his <i>Exercises</i>, in explaining them to influential
      persons, and in inducing many to try their effect upon their own souls.
      Contarini begged for and received a MS. copy. Dr. Ortiz, the Ambassador
      of Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span> at Rome, submitted himself
      to the discipline, and became an enthusiastic supporter. &ldquo;It was then,&rdquo; says
      Ignatius, &ldquo;that I first won the favour and respect of learned and influential
      men.&rdquo; But the opposition was strong. The old accusations of heresy
      were revived. Ignatius demanded and was admitted to a private audience
      of the Pope. He has described the interview in one of his letters.<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> He
      spoke with His Holiness for more than an hour in his private room;
      he explained the views and intentions of himself and of his companions;
      he told how he had been accused of heresy several times in Spain and
      at Paris, how he had even been imprisoned at Alcala and Salamanca,
      and that in each case careful inquiry had established his innocence;
      he said he knew that men who wished to preach incurred a great responsibility
      before God and man, and that they must be free from every taint of
      erroneous doctrine; and he besought the Pope to examine and test him
      thoroughly.<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> On
      Sept. 27th, 1540, the Bull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg
      549]</a></span> <i>Regimini militantis ecclesi&aelig;</i> was published,
      and the <i>Company of Jesus</i> was founded. The student band of Montmartre,
      the association of revivalist preachers of Vicenza, became a new Order,
      a holy militia pledged to fight for the Papacy against all its assailants
      everywhere and at all costs. In the Bull the members of the Company
      were limited to sixty, whether as a concession to opponents or in accordance
      with the wishes of Ignatius, is unknown. It might have been from the
      latter cause. In times of its greatest popularity the number of members
      of full standing has never been very large&mdash;not more than one
      per cent of those who bear the name.<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> The
      limitation, from whatever motive it was inserted, was removed in a
      second Bull, <i>Injunctum nobis</i>, dated March 14th, 1543.</p>
<h3>&sect; 5. <i>The Society of Jesus.</i></h3>
<p>On April 4th, 1541, six out of the ten original members of the Order (four
      were absent from Rome) met to elect their General; three of those at
      a distance sent their votes in writing; Ignatius was chosen unanimously.
      He declined the honour, and was again elected on April 7th. He gave
      way, and on April 22nd (1541) he received the vows of his associates
      in the church of <i>San Paolo fuori le mura</i>.</p>
<p>The new Order became famous at once; numbers sought to join it; and Ignatius
      found himself compelled to admit more members than he liked. He felt
      that the more his Society increased in numbers and the wider its sphere
      of activity, the greater the need for a strict system of laws to govern
      it. All other Orders of monks had their rules, which stated the duties
      of the members, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg
      550]</a></span> mode of their living together, and expressed the common
      sentiment which bound them to each other. The Company of Jesus, which
      from the first was intended to have a strict military discipline, and
      whose members were meant to be simply dependent units in a great machine
      moved by the man chosen to be their General, required such rules even
      more than any other. Ignatius therefore set himself to work on a Constitution.
      All we know of the first Constitution presented by the ten original
      members when they had their audience with Pope Paul <span class="smcap">III.</span>,
      is contained in the Bull of Foundation, and it is evident that it was
      somewhat vague. It did contain, however, four features, perhaps five,
      if the fourth vow of special obedience to the Pope be included, which
      were new. The Company was to be a fighting Order, a holy militia; it
      was to work for the propagation of the faith, especially by the education
      of the young; the members were not to wear any special or distinctive
      dress; and the power placed in the hands of the General was much greater
      than that permitted to the heads of any other of the monastic Orders.
      At the same time, constitutional limitations, resembling those in other
      Orders, were placed on the power of the General. There was to be a
      council, consisting of a majority of the members, whom the General
      was ordered to consult on all important occasions; and in less weighty
      matters he was bound to take the advice of the brethren near him. Proposed
      changes tending to free the General from these limitations were given
      effect to in the Bulls, <i>Licet debitum pastoralis officii</i> (Oct.
      18th, 1549) and <i>Exposcit pastoralis officii</i> (July 21st, 1550);
      but the Bulls themselves make it clear that the Constitution had not
      taken final form even then. It is probable that the completed Constitution
      drafted by Ignatius was not given to the Society until after his death.</p>
<p>The way in which he went to work was characteristic of the man, at once
      sternly practical and wildly visionary. He first busied himself with
      arrangements for starting the educational work which the Company had
      undertaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg
      551]</a></span> to do; he assorted the members of his Society into
      various classes;<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> and
      then he turned to the Constitution. He asked four of his original companions,
      Lainez, Salmeron, Broet, and Jay, all of whom were in Rome, to go carefully
      over all the promises which had been made to the Pope, or what might
      be implied in them, and from this material to form a draft Constitution.
      He gave them one direction only to guide them in their work: they were
      to see that nothing was set down which might imply that it was a deadly
      sin to alter the rules of the Company in time to come. The fundamental
      aim of his Company was different from that of all other Orders. It
      was not to consist of societies of men who lived out of the world to
      save their own souls, as did the Benedictines; nor was it established
      merely to be a preaching association, like the Dominicans; it was more
      than a fraternity of love, like the Franciscans. It was destined to
      aid fellow-men in every way possible; and by fellow-men Ignatius meant
      the obedient children of the catholic hierarchical Church. It was to
      fight the enemies of God&rsquo;s Vicar upon earth with every weapon available.
      The rules of other Orders could not help him much. He had to think
      all out for himself. During these months and years Ignatius kept a
      diary, in which he entered as in a ledger his moods of mind, the thoughts
      that passed through it, the visions he saw, and the hours at which
      they came to him.<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> Every
      possible problem connected with the Constitution of his Company was
      pondered painfully. It took him a month&rsquo;s meditation ere he saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[Pg
      552]</a></span> how to define the relation of the Society to property.
      Every solution came to him in a flash with the effect of a revelation,
      usually in the short hour before Mass. Once, he records, it took place &ldquo;on
      the street as I returned from Cardinal Carpi.&rdquo; It was in this way that
      the Constitution grew under his hands, and he believed that both it
      and the <i>Exercises</i> were founded on direct revelations from God.</p>
<p>This was the Constitution which was presented by Lainez to the assembly
      which elected him the successor of Loyola (July 2nd, 1558). The new
      General added a commentary or <i>Directorium</i> of his own, which
      was also accepted. It received papal sanction under Pius <span class="smcap">IV.</span></p>
<p>In this Constitution the Society of Jesus was revealed as an elaborate
      hierarchy rising from Novices through Scholastics, Coadjutors, Professed
      of Four Vows, with the General at its head, an autocrat, controlling
      every part, even the minutest, of the great machine. Nominally, he
      was bound by the Constitution, but the inner principle of this elaborate
      system of laws was apparent fixity of type qualified by the utmost
      laxity in practice. The most stable principles of the Constitution
      were explained or explained away in the <i>Directorium</i>, and by
      such an elaborate labyrinth of exceptions that it proved no barrier
      to the will of the General. He stood with his hand on the lever, and
      could do as he pleased with the vast machine, which responded in all
      its parts to his slightest touch. He had almost unlimited power of &ldquo;dispensing
      with formalities, freeing from obligations, shortening and lengthening
      the periods of initiation, retarding or advancing a member in his career.&rdquo; Every
      member of the Society was bound to obey his immediate superiors as
      if they stood for him in the place of Christ, and that to the extent
      of doing what he considered wrong, of believing that black was white
      if the General so willed it. The General resided at Rome, holding all
      the threads of the complicated affairs of the Society in his hands,
      receiving minute reports of the secret and personal history of every
      one of its members,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[Pg
      553]</a></span> dealing as he pleased with the highest as well as the
      lowest of his subordinates.</p>
<blockquote>
      <p>&ldquo;Yet the General of the Jesuits, like the Doge of Venice, had his
            hands tied by subtly powerful though almost invisible fetters.
            He was subjected at every hour of the day and night to the surveillance
            of five sworn spies, especially appointed to prevent him from
            altering the type or neglecting the concerns of the Order. The
            first of these functionaries, named the Administrator, who was
            frequently also the confessor of the General, exhorted him to
            obedience, and reminded him that he must do all things for the
            glory of God. Obedience and the glory of God, in Jesuit phraseology,
            meant the maintenance of the Company. The other four were styled
            Assistants. They had under their charge the affairs of the chief
            provinces; one overseeing the Indies, another Portugal and Spain,
            a third France and Germany, a fourth Italy and Sicily. Together
            with the Administrator, the Assistants were nominated by the
            General Congregation (an assembly of the Professed of the Four
            Vows), and could not be removed or replaced without its sanction.
            It was their duty to regulate the daily life of the General,
            to control his private expenditure on the scale which they determined,
            to prescribe what he should eat and drink, to appoint his hours
            for sleep, and religious exercises, and the transaction of public
            business.... The Company of Jesus was thus based upon a system
            of mutual and pervasive espionage. The novice on entering had
            all his acts, habits, and personal qualities registered. As he
            advanced in his career, he was surrounded by jealous brethren,
            who felt it their duty to report his slightest weakness to a
            superior. The superiors were watched by one another and by their
            inferiors. Masses of secret information poured into the secret
            cabinet of the General; and the General himself ate, slept, prayed,
            worked, and moved beneath the fixed gaze of ten vigilant eyes.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Historians have not been slow to point out the evils which this Society
      has wrought in the world, its purely political aims, the worldliness
      which deadened its spiritual life, and its degradation of morals, which
      had so much to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[Pg
      554]</a></span> do with sapping the ethical life of the seventeenth
      and eighteenth centuries. It is frequently said that the cool-headed
      Lainez is responsible for most of the evil, and that a change may be
      dated from his Generalship. There seems to be a wide gulf fixed between
      the Mystic of Manresa, the revival preacher of Vicenza, the genuine
      home mission work in Rome, and the astute, ruthless worldly political
      work of the Society. Yet almost all the changes may be traced back
      to one root, the conception which Ignatius held of what was meant by
      true religion. It was for him, from first to last, an unreasoning,
      blind obedience to the dictates of the catholic hierarchic Church.
      It was this which poisoned the very virtues which gave Loyola&rsquo;s intentions
      their strength, and introduced an inhuman element from the start.</p>
<p>He set out with the noble thought that he would work for the good of his
      fellow-men; but his idea of religion narrowed his horizon. His idea
      of &ldquo;neighbour&rdquo;
      never went beyond the thought of one who owed entire obedience to the
      Roman Pontiff&mdash;all others were as much outside the sphere of the
      brotherhood of mankind as the followers of Mahomet were for the earliest
      Crusaders. Godfrey of Bouillon was both devout and tender-hearted,
      yet when he rode, a conqueror, into Jerusalem up the street filled
      with the corpses of slaughtered Moslems, he saw a babe wriggling on
      the breast of its dead mother, and, stooping in his saddle, he seized
      it by the ankle and dashed its head against the wall. For Ignatius,
      as for Godfrey, all outside the catholic and hierarchic Church were
      not men, but wolves.</p>
<p>He was filled with the heroic conception that his Company was to aid their
      fellow-men in every department of earthly life, and the political drove
      out all other considerations; for it contained the spheres within which
      the whole human life is lived. Thus, while he preferred for himself
      the society of learned and devout men, his acute Basque brain soon
      perceived their limitations, and the Jesuit historian Orlandino tells
      us that Ignatius selected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg
      555]</a></span> the members of his Company from men who knew the world,
      and were of good social position. He forbade very rightly the follies
      of ascetic piety, when the discipline of the <i>Exercises</i> had been
      accomplished; it was only repeated when energies flagged or symptoms
      of insubordination appeared. Then the General ordered a second course,
      as a physician sends a patient to the cure at some watering-place.
      The Constitution directs that novices were to be sought among those
      who had a comely presence, with good memories, manageable tempers,
      quick observation, and free from all indiscreet devotion. The Society
      formed to fight the Renaissance as well as Protestantism, borrowed
      from its enemy the thought of general culture, training every part
      of the mind and body, and rendering the possessor a man of the world.</p>
<p>No one can read the letters of Ignatius without seeing the fund of native
      tenderness that there was in the stern Spanish soldier. That it was
      no mere sentiment appears in many ways, and in none more so than in
      his infinite pity for the crowds of fallen women in Rome, and in his
      wise methods of rescue work. It was this tenderness which led him to
      his greatest mistake. He held that no one could be saved who was not
      brought to a state of abject obedience to the hierarchic Church; that
      such obedience was the only soil in which true virtues could be planted
      and grow. He believed, moreover, that the way in which the &ldquo;common
      man&rdquo; could be thoroughly broken to this obedience was through the confessional
      and the directorate, and therefore that no one should be scared from
      confession or from trust in his director by undue severity. In his
      eagerness to secure these inestimable benefits for the largest number
      of men, he over and over again enjoined the members of his Society
      to be very cautious in coming to the conclusion that any of their penitents
      was guilty of a mortal sin. Such was the almost innocent beginning
      of that Jesuit casuistry which in the end almost wiped out the possibility
      of anyone who professed obedience committing a mortal sin, and occasioned
      the profane description<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg
      556]</a></span> of Father Bauny, the famous French director&mdash;&ldquo;Bauny
      qui tollit peccata mundi per definitionem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Society thus organised became powerful almost at once. It made rapid
      progress in Italy. Lainez was sent to Venice, and fought the slumbering
      Protestantism there, at Brescia, and in the Val Tellina. Jay was sent
      to Ferrara to counteract the influence of Ren&eacute;e of France, its
      Duchess. Salmeron went to Naples and Sicily. The chief Italian towns
      welcomed the members of the new Order. Noble and devout ladies gave
      their aid. Colleges were opened; schools, where the education was not
      merely free, but superior to what was usually given, were soon crowded
      with pupils. Rome remained the centre and stronghold of the Company.</p>
<p>Portugal was won at once. Xavier and Rodriguez were sent there. They won
      over King John, and he speedily became their obedient pupil. He delivered
      into their hands his new University at Coimbra, and the Humanist teachers,
      George Buchanan among them, were persecuted and dispersed, and replaced
      by Jesuit professors.</p>
<p>Spain was more difficult to win. The land was the stronghold of the Dominicans,
      and had been so for generations; and they were unwilling to admit any
      intruders. But the new Order soon gained ground. It was native to the
      soil. It had its roots in that Mysticism which pervaded the whole Peninsula.
      Ignatius gained one distinguished convert, Francis Borgia, Duke of
      Candia and Viceroy of Catalonia. He placed the University he had founded
      in their hands. He joined the Order, and became the third General.
      His influence counterbalanced the suspicions of Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span>,
      who had no liking for sworn bondmen of the Vatican, and they soon laid
      firm hold on the people.</p>
<p>In France their progress was slow. The University and the <i>Parlement</i> of
      Paris opposed them, and the Sorbonne made solemn pronouncement against
      their doctrine. Still they were able to found Colleges at St. Omer,
      Douai, and Rheims.</p>
<p>Ignatius had his eye on Germany from the first. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg
                  557]</a></span> longed to combat heresy in the land of
                  its birth. Boabdilla, Faber, and Jay were sent there at
                  once. Boabdilla won the confidence of William, Duke of
                  Bavaria; Jay insinuated himself into the counsels of Ferdinand
                  of Austria, and Faber did the most important work of the
                  three by winning for the Society, Petrus Canisius. He was
                  the son of a patrician of Nymwegen, trained in Humanist
                  lore, drawn by inner sympathy to the Christian Mysticism
                  of Tauler, and yet steadfast in his adherence to the theology
                  of the medi&aelig;val Church. Faber soon became conscious
                  of his own deficiencies for the work to be done in Germany.
                  His first appearance was at the Religious Conference at
                  Worms, where he found himself face to face with Calvin
                  and Melanchthon, and where his colleagues, Eck and Cochl&aelig;us,
                  were rather ashamed of him. The enthusiastic Savoyard lacked
                  almost everything for the position into which, at the bidding
                  of his General, he had thrust himself. Since then he had
                  been wandering through those portions of Germany which
                  had remained faithful to Rome, seeking individual converts
                  to the principles of the Society, and above all some one
                  who had the gifts for the work Ignatius hoped to do in
                  that country. It is somewhat interesting to note that almost
                  all the German Roman Catholics who were attracted by him
                  to the new Order were men who had leanings towards the
                  fourteenth century Mystics&mdash;men like Gerard Hammond,
                  Prior of the Carthusians of K&ouml;ln. Faber caught Canisius
                  by means of his Mysticism. He met him at Mainz, explained
                  the <i>Exercitia Spiritualia</i> to him, induced the young
                  man to undergo the course of discipline which they prescribed,
                  and won him for Loyola and the Company. &ldquo;He is the man,&rdquo;
      wrote Faber to Ignatius, &ldquo;whom I have been seeking&mdash;if he is a
      man, and not rather an angel of the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ignatius speedily recognised the value of the new recruit. He saw that
      he was not a man to be kept long in the lower ranks of the Company,
      and gave him more liberty of action than he allowed to his oldest associates.
      Faber had sent him grievous reports about the condition of affairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg
      558]</a></span> in Germany. &ldquo;It is not misinterpretation of Scripture,&rdquo;
      he wrote, &ldquo;not specious arguments, not the Lutherans with their preaching
      and persuasions, that have lost so many provinces and towns to the
      Roman Church, but the scandalous lives of the ministers of religion.&rdquo; He
      felt his helplessness. He was a foreigner, and the Germans did not
      like strangers. He could not speak their language, and his Latin gave
      him a very limited audience. People and priests looked on him as a
      spy sent to report their weaknesses to Rome. When he discoursed about
      the <i>Exercitia</i>, and endeavoured to induce men to try them, he
      was accused of urging a &ldquo;new religion.&rdquo; When he attempted to form student
      associations in connection with the Company, it was said that he was
      urging the formation of &ldquo;conventicles&rdquo; outside the Church&rsquo;s ordinances.
      But the adhesion of Canisius changed all that. He was a German, one
      of themselves; his orthodoxy was undisputed; he was an eminent scholar,
      the most distinguished of the young masters of the University of K&ouml;ln,
      a leader among its most promising students. Under his guidance the
      student associations grew strong; after his example young men offered
      themselves for the discipline of the <i>Exercises</i>. Loyola saw that
      he had gained a powerful assistant. He longed to see him personally
      at Rome; but he was so convinced of his practical wisdom that he left
      it to himself either to come to Italy or to remain in Germany. Canisius
      decided to remain. Affairs at K&ouml;ln were then in a critical state.
      The Archbishop-Elector, Hermann von Wied, favoured the Reformation.
      He had thoughts of secularising his Electorate, and if lie succeeded
      in his design his example might be followed in another ecclesiastical
      Electorate, with the result that the next Emperor would be a Protestant.
      Canisius organised the people, the clergy, the University authorities
      against this, and succeeded in defeating the designs of the Archbishop.
      When his work at K&ouml;ln was done, he went to Vienna. There he became
      the confessor and private adviser of Ferdinand of Austria, administered
      the affairs of the diocese of Vienna during a long episcopal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg
      559]</a></span> interregnum, helped to found its Jesuit College, and
      another at Ingolstadt. These Colleges became the centres of Jesuit
      influence in Germany, and helped to spread the power of the Society.
      But with all this activity it can scarcely be said that the Company
      was very powerful in that country until years after the Council of
      Trent.</p>
<p>The foreign mission activity of the Jesuits has been often described,
      and much of the early progress of the Company has been attributed to
      the admiration created by the work of Francis Xavier and his companions.
      This was undoubtedly true; but in the earliest times it was the home
      mission successes that drew most attention and sympathy; and these
      have been too often left unmentioned.</p>
<p>Nothing lay nearer the hearts of devout persons who refused to accept
      the Reformation than the condition of the great proportion of the Roman
      Catholic priests in all countries, and the depravity of morals among
      laity and clergy alike. Ignatius was deeply affected by both scandals,
      and had resolved from the first to do his best to cure them. It was
      this resolve and the accompanying strenuous endeavours which won Ignatius
      the respect and sympathy of all those in Italy who were sighing for
      a reform in the moral life of people and clergy, and brought the Company
      of Jesus into line with Italian Reformers like Contarini, Ghiberti,
      and Vittoria Colonna. His system of Colleges and the whole use he made
      of education could have only one result&mdash;to give an educated clergy
      to the Roman Church. It was a democratic extension of the work of Caraffa
      and Gaetano da Thiene. Ignatius had also clear views about the way
      to produce a reformation of morals in Rome. Like Luther, he insisted
      that it must begin in the individual life, and could not be produced
      by stringent legislation; &ldquo;it must start in the individual, spread
      to the family, and then permeate the metropolis.&rdquo; But meanwhile something
      might be done to heal the worst running sores of society. Like Luther,
      Ignatius fastened on three&mdash;the waste of child life, the plague
      of begging, and what is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg
      560]</a></span> called the &ldquo;social evil&rdquo;; if his measure of success
      in dealing with the evils fell far short of Luther&rsquo;s, the more corrupted
      condition of Italy had something to do with his failure.</p>
<p>His first measure of social reform was to gather Roman children, either
      orphans or deserted by their parents. They were gratuitously housed,
      fed, and taught in a simple fashion, and were instructed in the various
      mechanical arts which could enable them to earn a living. In a brief
      time, Ignatius had over two hundred boys and girls in his two industrial
      schools.</p>
<p>How to cure the plague of beggars which infested all Roman Catholic countries,
      a curse for which the teaching of the medi&aelig;val Church was largely
      responsible,<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> had
      been a problem studied by Ignatius ever since his brief visit to his
      native place in 1535. There he had attempted to get the town council
      of Azpeitia to forbid begging within the bounds of the city, and to
      support the deserving and helpless poor at the town&rsquo;s cost. He urged
      the same policy on the chief men in Rome. When he failed in his large
      and public schemes, he attempted to work them out by means of charitable
      associations connected with and fostered by his Society.</p>
<p>Nothing, however, excited the sympathy of Loyola so much as the numbers
      and condition of fallen women in all the larger Italian towns. He was
      first struck with it in Venice, where he declared that he would willingly
      give his life to hinder a day&rsquo;s sin of one of these unfortunates. The
      magnitude of the evil in Rome appalled him. He felt that it was too
      great for him to meddle with as a whole. Something, however, he could
      attempt, and did. In Rome, which swarmed with men vowed to celibacy
      simply because they had something to do with the Church, prostitution
      was frequently concealed under the cloak of marriage. Husbands lived
      by the sinful life of their wives. Deserted wives also swelled the
      ranks of unfortunates. Loyola provided homes for any such as might
      wish to leave their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg
      561]</a></span> degrading life. At first they were simply taken into
      families whom Ignatius persuaded to receive them. The numbers of the
      rescued grew so rapidly that special houses were needed. Ignatius called
      them &ldquo;Martha-Houses.&rdquo;
      They were in no sense convents. There was, of course, oversight, but
      the idea was to provide a bright home where these women could earn
      their own living or the greater part of it. The scheme spread to many
      of the large Italian towns, and many ladies were enlisted in the plans
      to help their fallen sisters.</p>
<p>Loyola&rsquo;s associations to provide ransom for Christian captives among the
      Moslems, his attempts to discredit duelling, his institutions for loans
      to the poor, can only be alluded to. It was these works of Christian
      charity which undoubtedly gained the immediate sympathy for the Company
      which awaited it in most lands south of the Alps.</p>
<p>Almost all earlier monastic Orders provided a place for women among their
      organisation. An Order of Nuns corresponded to the Order of Monks.
      Few founders of monastic Orders have owed so much to women as Ignatius
      did. A few ladies of Barcelona were his earliest disciples, were the
      first to undergo the discipline of the <i>Exercises</i>, then in an
      imperfect shape, and encouraged him when he needed it most by their
      faith in him and his plans.<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> One
      of them, Isabella Roser (Rosel, Rosell), a noble matron, wife of Juan
      Roser, heard Ignatius deliver one of his first sermons, and was so
      impressed by it, that she and her husband invited him to stay in their
      house, which he did. She paid all his expenses while he went to school
      and college in Spain. She and her friends sent him large sums of money
      when he was in Paris. Ignatius could never have carried out his plans
      but for her sympathy and assistance. In spite of all this, Ignatius
      came early to the conclusion that his Company should have as little
      as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span> possible
      to do with the direction of women&rsquo;s souls (it took so much time, he
      complained); that women were too emotional to endure the whole discipline
      of the <i>Exercises</i>; and that there must never be Jesuit nuns.
      The work he meant his Company to do demanded such constant and strained
      activity&mdash;a Jesuit must stand with only one foot on the ground,
      he said, the other must be raised ready to start wherever he was despatched&mdash;that
      women were unfit for it. That was his firm resolve, and he was to suffer
      for it.</p>
<p>In 1539 he had written to Isabella Roser that he hoped God would forget
      him if he ever forgot all that she had done for him; and it is probable
      that some sentences (unintentional on the part of the writer) had made
      the lady, now a widow, believe that she was destined to play the part
      of Clara to this Francis. At all events (1543) she came to Rome, accompanied
      by two friends bringing with them a large sum of money, sorely needed
      by Ignatius to erect his house in Rome for the Professed of the Four
      Vows. In return, they asked him to give some time to advise them in
      spiritual things. This Ignatius did, but not with the minuteness nor
      at the length expected. He declared that the guidance of the souls
      of the three ladies for three days cost him more than the oversight
      of his whole Society for a month. Then it appeared that Isabella Roser
      wanted more. She was a woman of noble gifts, no weak sentimental enthusiast.
      She had studied theology widely and profoundly. Her learning and abilities
      impressed the Cardinals whom she met and with whom she talked. She
      desired Ignatius to create an Order of Jesuit nuns of whom she should
      be the head. When he refused there was a great quarrel. She demanded
      back the money she had given; and when this was refused, she raised
      an action in the Roman courts. She lost her case, and returned indignant
      to Spain.<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> Poor
      Isabella Roser&mdash;she was not a derelict, and so less interesting
      to a physician of souls; but she needed comforting like other people.
      She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span> forgave
      her old friend, and their correspondence was renewed. She died the
      year before Ignatius.</p>
<p>When the Society of Jesus was at the height of its power in the seventeenth
      century, another and equally unsuccessful attempt was made to introduce
      an Order of Jesuit nuns.</p>
<p>Ignatius died at the age of sixty-five, thirty-five years after his conversion,
      and sixteen after his Order had received the apostolic benediction.
      His Company had become the most powerful force within the reanimated
      Roman Church; it had largely moulded the theology of Trent; and it
      seemed to be winning back Germany. It had spread in the swiftest fashion.
      Ignatius had seen established twelve Provinces&mdash;Portugal, Castile,
      Aragon, Andalusia, Italy (Lombardy and Tuscany), Naples, Sicily, Germany,
      Flanders, France, Brazil, and the East Indies.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<h3>THE COUNCIL OF TRENT.<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a></h3>
<h3>&sect; 1. <i>The Assembling of the Council.</i></h3>
<p>The General Council, the subject of many negotiations between the Emperor
      and the Pope, was at last finally fixed to meet at Trent in 1545.<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> The
      city was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[Pg
      565]</a></span> capital of a small episcopal principality, its secular
      overlord was the Count of the Tyrol, whose deputy resided in the town.
      It was a frontier place with about a thousand houses, including four
      or five fine buildings and a large palace of the Prince Bishop. It
      contained several churches, one of which, Santa Maria Maggiore, was
      reserved for the meetings of the Council.<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> Its
      inhabitants were partly Italian and partly German&mdash;the two nationalities
      living in separate quarters and retaining their distinctive customs
      and dress. It was a small place for such an assembly, and could not
      furnish adequate accommodation for the crowd of visitors a General
      Council always involved.</p>
<p>The Papal Legates entered Trent in state on the 13th of March (1545).
      Heavy showers of rain marred the impressive display. They were received
      by the local clergy with enthusiasm, and by the populace with an absolute
      indifference. Months passed before the Council was opened. Few delegates
      were present when the papal Legates arrived. The representatives of
      the Emperor and those of Venice came early; Bishops arrived in straggling
      groups during April and May and the months that followed. The necessary
      papal Brief did not reach the town till the 11th of December, and the
      Council was formally opened on the 13th. The long leisurely opening
      was symptomatic of the history of the Council. Its proceedings were
      spread over a period of eighteen years:&mdash;under Pope Paul <span class="smcap">III.</span>,
      1545-47, including Sessions i. to x.; under Pope Julius <span class="smcap">III.</span>,
      1551-52, including Sessions xi. to xvi.; under Pope Pius <span class="smcap">IV.</span>,
      1562-1563, including Sessions xvii. to xxv.<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a></p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</a></p>
<p>The Papal Legates were Gian Maria Giocchi, Cardinal del Monte, a Tuscan
      who had early entered the service of the Roman Curia, a profound jurist
      and a choleric man of fifty-seven (<i>first</i> President); Marcello
      Cervini, Cardinal da Santa Croce; and Cardinal Reginald Pole, the Englishman.
      The three represented the three tendencies which were apparent in ecclesiastical
      Italy. The first belonged to the party which stood by the old unreformed
      Curia, and wished no change. Cervini represented the growing section
      of the Church, which regarded Cardinal Caraffa as their leader. They
      sought eagerly and earnestly a reform in life and character, especially
      among the clergy; but refused to make any concessions in doctrines,
      ceremonies, or institutions to the Protestants. They differed from
      the more reforming Spanish and French ecclesiastical leaders in their
      dislike of secular interference, and believed that the Popes should
      have more rather than less power. Reginald Pole was one of those liberal
      Roman Catholics of whom Cardinal Contarini was the distinguished leader.
      He was made a Legate probably to conciliate his associates. He was
      a man whom most people liked and nobody feared&mdash;a harmless, pliant
      tool in the hands of a diplomatist like Cervini. The new Society of
      Jesus was represented by Lainez and Salmeron, who went to the Council
      with the dignity of papal theologians&mdash;a title which gave them
      a special standing and influence.</p>
<p>According to the arrangement come to between the Emperor and the Pope,
      the Bull summoning the Council declared that it was called for the
      three purposes of overcoming the religious schism; of reforming the
      Church; and of calling a united Christendom to a crusade against unbelievers.
      By general consent the work of the Council was limited to the first
      two objects. They were stated in terms vague enough to cover real diversity
      of opinion about the work the Council was expected to do.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</a></p>
<p>Almost all believed that the questions of reforming the Church and dealing
      with the religious revolt were inseparably connected; but the differences
      at once emerged when the method of treating the schism was discussed.</p>
<p>Many pious Roman Catholics believed that the Lutheran movement was a divine
      punishment for the sins of the Church, and that it would disappear
      if the Church was thoroughly reformed in life and morals. They differed
      about the agency to be employed to effect the reformation. The Italian
      party, who followed Cardinal Caraffa, maintained that full powers should
      be in the hands of the Pope; non-Italians, especially the Spaniards,
      thought it vain to look for any such reformation so long as the Curia,
      itself the seat of the greatest corruption, remained unreformed, and
      contended that the secular authority ought to be allowed more power
      to put down ecclesiastical scandals.</p>
<p>The Emperor, Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span>, had come to believe
      that there were no insuperable differences of doctrine between the
      Lutherans and the Roman Catholics, and that mutual explanations and
      a real desire to give and take, combined with the removal of scandals
      which all alike deplored, would heal the schism. He had never seen
      the gulf which the Lutheran principle of the spiritual priesthood of
      all believers had created between the Protestants and medi&aelig;val
      doctrines and ceremonies.<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> He
      persisted in this belief long after the proceedings at Trent had left
      him hopeless of seeing the reconciliation he had expected brought about
      by the Council he had done so much to get summoned. The Augsburg Interim
      (1548) shows what he thought might have been done.<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> He
      was badly seconded at Trent. The only Bishop who supported his views
      heartily was Madruzzo, the Prince Bishop of Trent; his representative,
      Diego de Mendoza, fell ill shortly after the opening of the Council,
      and his substitute, Francisco de Toledo, did not reach Trent until
      March 1546.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</a></p>
<h3>&sect; 2. <i>Procedure at the Council.</i></h3>
<p>Tho ablest of the three Legates, Cervini, had a definite plan of procedure
      before him. He knew thoroughly the need for drastic reforms in the
      life and morals of the clergy and for purifying the Roman Curia; but,
      with the memories of Basel and Constance before him, he dreaded above
      all things a conflict between the Pope and the Council, and he believed
      that such a quarrel was imminent if the Council itself undertook to
      reform the Curia. His idea was that the Council ought to employ itself
      in the useful, even necessary task of codifying the doctrines of the
      Church, so that all men might discern easily what was the true Catholic
      faith. While this was being done, opportunity would be given to the
      Pope himself to reform the Curia&mdash;a task which would be rendered
      easier by the consciousness that he had the sympathy of the Council
      behind him. He scarcely concealed his opinion that such codification
      should make no concessions to the Protestants, but would rather show
      them to be in hopeless antagonism to the Catholic faith. He did not
      propose any general condemnation of what he thought to be Lutheran
      errors; but he wished the separate points of doctrine which the Lutherans
      had raised&mdash;Justification, the authority of Holy Scripture, the
      Sacraments&mdash;to be examined carefully and authoritatively defined.
      In this way heretics would be taught the error of their ways without
      mentioning names, and without the specific condemnation of individuals.
      He expounded his plan of procedure to the Council.</p>
<p>His suggestions were by no means universally well received by the delegates.
      The proposal to leave reforms to the Pope provoked many speeches from
      the Spanish Bishops, full of bitter reproaches against the Curia; and
      his conception of codifying the doctrines of the Church with the avowed
      intention of irrevocably excluding the Lutherans was by no means liked
      by many.</p>
<p>A great debate took place on Jan. 18th, which revealed to the Legate that
      probably the majority of the delegates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[Pg
      569]</a></span> did not favour his proposed course of procedure. Madruzzo,
      the eloquent Prince Bishop of Trent, and a Cardinal, made a long speech,
      in which he asserted that the Council should not rashly take for granted
      that the Lutherans were irreconcilable. They ought to acknowledge frankly
      that the corrupt morals of the medi&aelig;val clergy had done much
      to cause dissatisfaction and to justify revolt. Let them therefore
      assume that these evils for which the Church was responsible had produced
      the schism. Let them invite the Protestants to come among them as brethren.
      Let them show to those men, who had no doubt erred in doctrine, that
      the Catholic Church was sincerely anxious to reform the abounding evils
      in life and morals, and, with this fraternal bond between them, let
      them reason amicably together about the doctrinal differences which
      now separated them. The eloquent and large-minded Cardinal condensed
      the recommendations in his speech in one sentence: &ldquo;Cum corrupti mores
      ecclesiasticorum dederint occasionem Lutheranis confingendi falsa dogmata,
      sublata causa, facilius tolletur effectus; subdens optimum fore, si
      protestantes ipsos amicabiliter et fraterne literis invitaremus, ut
      ipsi quoque ad synodum venirent, et se etiam reformari paterentur.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> We
      are told that this speech raised great enthusiasm among the delegates,
      and that the Legates had some difficulty in preventing its proposal
      from being universally accepted. At the most they were able to prevent
      any definite conclusion being come to about the procedure at the close
      of the sitting. Cervini saw that he could not get his way adopted.
      He agreed that proposals for reform and for the codification of doctrine
      should be discussed simultaneously, his knowledge of theological nature
      telling him that if he once got so many divines engaged in doctrinal
      discussions two things would surely follow: their eagerness would make
      them neglect everything else, and their polemical instincts would carry
      them beyond the point where a conciliation of the Protestants required
      them to come to a halt. So it happened. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[Pg
      570]</a></span> Council found itself committed to a codification and
      definition of Catholic doctrine. The suggestion of the Bishop of Feltre
      (Thomas Campeggio) was adopted, that the discussion of doctrines and
      the proposals for reform should be discussed by two separate Commissions,
      whose reports should come before the Synod alternately. The Legates
      obtained a large majority for this course, and the protest of Madruzzo
      was unavailing.</p>
<p>The decision to attack the question of reform was very unacceptable to
      the Pope. He went so far as to ask the Legates to get it rescinded;
      but that was impossible, and he had to content himself with the assurances
      of Cervini that no real harm would come of it.</p>
<p>This important question being settled, the Council decided upon the details
      of procedure. The whole Synod was divided into three divisions or Commissions,
      to each of which allotted work was given. Each question was first of
      all to be prepared for the section by theologians and canonists, then
      discussed in the special Commission to which it had been entrusted.
      If approved there, it was to be brought before a general Congregation
      of the whole Synod for discussion. If it passed this scrutiny, it was
      to be promulgated in a solemn session of the Council.</p>
<h3>&sect; 3. <i>Restatement of Doctrines.</i></h3>
<p>It ought to be said, before describing the doctrinal labours of the Council,
      that the work done at Trent was not to give Conciliar sanction to the
      whole mass of medi&aelig;val doctrinal tradition. There was a thorough
      revision of doctrinal positions in which a great deal of theology which
      had been current during the later Middle Ages was verbally rejected,
      and the rejection was most apparent in that Scotist theology which
      had been popular before the Reformation, and which had been most strongly
      attacked by Luther. The Scotist theology, with its theological scepticism,
      was largely repudiated in name at least&mdash;whether its spirit was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[Pg
      571]</a></span> banished is another question which has to be discussed
      later. A great many influences unknown during the later Middle Ages
      pressed consciously and unconsciously upon the divines assembled at
      Trent and coloured their dogmatic work. Although the avowed intention
      of the theologians there was to defeat both Humanism and the Reformation,
      they could not avoid being influenced by both movements. Humanism had
      led many of them to study the earlier Church Fathers, and they could
      not escape Augustine in doing so. They were led to him by many paths.
      The Dominican theologians had begun, quite independently of the Reformation,
      to study the great theologian of their Order, and Thomas had led them
      back to Augustine. The Reformation had laid stress on the doctrines
      of sin, of justification, and of predestination, and had therefore
      awakened a new interest in them and consequently in Augustine. The
      New Thomism, with Augustinianism behind it, was a feature of the times,
      and was the strongest influence at work among the theologians who assembled
      at Trent. It could not fail to make their doctrinal results take a
      very different form from the theology which Luther was taught by John
      Nathin in the Erfurt convent. Christian Mysticism, too, had its revival,
      especially in Spain and in Italy, and among some of the reconstructed
      monastic orders. If it had small influence on the doctrines, it worked
      for a more spiritual conception of the Church. What has been called
      Curialism, the theory of the omnipotence of the Pope in all things
      connected with the Church&rsquo;s life, practice, and beliefs, was also a
      potent factor with some of the assembled fathers. But above all things
      the theologians who met at Trent were influenced by the thought and
      fact of the Lutheran Reformation. This is apparent in the order in
      which they discussed theological questions, in the subjects they selected
      and in those they omitted. All these things help us to understand how
      the theology of the Council of Trent was something peculiar, something
      by itself, and different both from what may be vaguely called medi&aelig;val<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[Pg
      572]</a></span> theology and from that of the modern Church of Rome.<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a></p>
<p>The Council, in its third session, laid the basis of its doctrinal work
      by reaffirming the Niceo-Constantinopolitan Creed with the <i>filioque</i> clause
      added, and significantly called it: Symbolum fidei quo sancta ecclesia <i>Romana</i> utitur.
      This done, it was ready to proceed with the codification and definition
      of doctrines.</p>
<p>On the 18th of April 1546, the Commission which had to do with the preparation
      of the subject reported, and the Council proceeded to discuss the sources
      of theological knowledge or the Rule of Faith. The influence of the
      Reformation is clearly seen not merely in the priority assigned to
      this subject, but also in the statement that the
      &ldquo;purity of the Gospel&rdquo; is involved in the decision come to. The opposition
      to Protestantism was made emphatic by the Council declaring these four
      things:</p>
<p>It accepted as canonical all the books contained in the Alexandrine Canon
      (the Septuagint), and therefore the Apocrypha of the Old Testament,
      and did so heedless of the fact that the editor of the Vulgate (afterwards
      pronounced authoritative), Jerome, had thought very little of the Apocrypha.
      The Reformers, in their desire to go back to the earliest and purest
      sources, had pronounced in favour of the Hebrew Canon; the Council,
      in spite of Jerome, accepted the common medi&aelig;val tradition.</p>
<p>It declared that in addition to the books of Holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[Pg
                  573]</a></span> Scripture, it &ldquo;receives with an equal feeling
                  of piety and reverence the traditions, whether relating
                  to faith or to morals, dictated either orally by Christ
                  or by the Holy Spirit, and preserved in continuous succession
                  within the Catholic Church.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a> The
                  practical effect of this declaration, something entirely
                  novel, was to assert that there was within the Church an
                  infallibly correct mode of interpreting Scripture, and
                  to give the ecclesiastical authorities (whoever they might
                  be) the means of warding off any Protestant attack based
                  upon Holy Scripture alone. The Council were careful to
                  avoid stating who were the guardians of this dogmatic tradition,
                  but in the end it led by easily traced steps to the declaration
                  of Pope Pius <span class="smcap">IX.</span>: <i>Io sono
                  la tradizione</i>, and placed a decision of a Pope speaking <i>ex
                  cathedra</i> on a level with the Word of God.</p>
<p>It proclaimed that the Vulgate version contained the authoritative text
      of Holy Scripture. This was also new, and, moreover, in violent opposition
      to the best usages of the medi&aelig;val Church. It cast aside as worse
      than useless the whole scholarship of the Renaissance both within and
      outside of the medi&aelig;val Church, and, on pretence of consecrating
      a text of Holy Scripture, reduced it to the state of a mummy, lifeless
      and unfruitful.<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a></p>
<p>It asserted that every faithful believer must accept the sense of Scripture
      which the Church teaches, that no one was to oppose the unanimous consensus
      of the Fathers&mdash;and this without defining what the Church is,
      or who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[Pg
      574]</a></span> the Fathers.<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> The
      whole trend of this decision was to place the authoritative exposition
      of the Scriptures in the hands of the Pope, although at the time the
      Council lacked the courage to say so.</p>
<p>It must not be supposed that these decisions were reached without a good
      deal of discussion. Some members of the Council would have preferred
      the Hebrew Canon. Nacchianti, Bishop of Chioggia, protested against
      placing traditions on the same level as Holy Scripture;<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> some
      wished to distinguish between apostolical traditions and others; but
      the final decision of the Council was carried by a large majority.
      The most serious conflict of opinion, however, arose about the clause
      which declared that the Vulgate version was the only authoritative
      one. It was held that such a decision entailed the prohibition of using
      translations of the Scripture in the mother tongue. The Spanish Bishops,
      in spite of the fact that translations of the Scriptures into Spanish
      had once been commonly used and their use encouraged, would have had
      all Bible reading in the mother tongue prohibited. The Germans protested.
      The debate waxed hot. Madruzzo, of Trent, eloquently declared that
      to prohibit the translation of the Scriptures into German would be
      a public scandal. Were children not to be taught the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer
      in a language they could understand? A Bull of Pope Paul <span class="smcap">II.</span> was
      cited against him. He replied that Popes had erred and were liable
      to err; but that the Apostle Paul had not erred, and that he had commanded
      the Scriptures to be read by every one, and that this could not be
      done unless they were translated. A compromise was suggested, that
      each country should decide for itself whether it would have translations
      of the Scriptures or not. In the end, however, the Vulgate was proclaimed
      the only authentic Word of God.</p>

<p>In the fifth session (June 17th, 1546) and in the sixth session (Jan.
      13th, 1547) the Council attacked the subjects of Original Sin and Justification.
      The Reformation had challenged the Roman Church to say whether it had
      any <i>spiritual</i> religion at all, or was simply an institution
      claiming to possess a secret science of salvation through ceremonies
      which required little or no spiritual life on the part of priests or
      recipients. The challenge had to be met not merely on account of the
      Protestants, but because devout Romanists had declared that it must
      be done. The answer was given in the two doctrines of Original Sin
      and Justification, as defined at the Council of Trent. They both deserve
      a much more detailed examination than space permits.</p>
<p>The Legates had felt that the Council as constituted might come to decisions
      giving room for Protestant doctrine, and pled with the Pope to send
      them more Italian Bishops, whose votes might counteract the weight
      of northern opinion (June 2nd, 1546). They were extremely anxious about
      the way in which the Council might deal with those two doctrines.</p>
<p>The first, the definition of Original Sin, <i>seems</i> to reject strongly
      that Pelagianism or Semi-Pelagianism which had marked the later Scholasticism
      which Luther had been taught in the Erfurt convent. It appears to rest
      on and to express the evangelical thoughts of Augustine. But a careful
      examination shows that it is full of ambiguities&mdash;intentional
      loop-holes provided for the retention of the Semi-Pelagian modes of
      thought. Space forbids our going over them all, but one example may
      be selected from the first chapter. It is there said that Adam lost
      the holiness and righteousness <i>in which he had been constituted</i>.
      Why not <i>created</i>? The phrase may mean created, and all the New
      Thomists at the Council doubtless read it in that way. By the Fall
      man lost what Thomas, following Augustine, had called increated righteousness.
      But the phrase <i>in qua constitutus fucrat</i> could easily be interpreted
      to mean that what man did lose were the superadded <i>dona</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[Pg
      576]</a></span> <i>supernaturalia</i> whose loss in no way impaired
      human nature; and, if so interpreted, room is provided for Pelagianism.<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> Again,
      while the Augustinian doctrine of the Fall seems to be taught, it is
      added that by Original Sin <i>liberum arbitrium</i> is <i>minime extinctum
      viribus licet attenuatum</i>, which is Semi-Pelagian.<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> The
      whole definition closes with a statement that it is not to be applied
      to the Blessed Virgin, the doctrine about whom has been expressed in
      the Constitutions of Pope Sixtus <span class="smcap">IV.</span> of
      happy memory.<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a></p>
<p>The statement of the Doctrine of Justification is a masterpiece of theological
      dexterity, and deserves much more consideration than can be given it.
      The whole treatment of the subject was the cause of considerable anxiety
      outside the Council. On the one hand, the Emperor Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span>,
      who was greatly disappointed at the course taken by the Council, and
      saw the chance of conciliating the Protestants diminishing daily, wished
      to defer all discussion; while the Pope, bent on making it impossible
      for the Protestants to return, desired the Council to define this important
      doctrine in such a way that none of the Reformed could possibly accept
      it. The Emperor&rsquo;s wishes were speedily overruled; but it was by no
      means easy for the Legates to carry out the desires of the Pope. There
      was a great deal of Evangelical doctrine in the Roman Church which
      had to be reckoned with. So much existed that at one time it had actually
      been proposed at the Vatican to approve of the first part of the Augsburg
      Confession in order to win the Protestants over.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[Pg
      577]</a></span> The day for such proposals was past; but the New Thomism
      was a power in the Church, and perhaps the strongest <i>theological</i> force
      at the Council of Trent, and had to be reckoned with. If the Protestant
      conception of Justification be treated merely as a doctrine,&mdash;which
      it is not, being really an experience deeper and wider than any form
      of words can contain,&mdash;if it be stated scholastically, then it
      is possible to express it in propositions which do not perceptibly
      differ from the doctrine of Justification in the New Thomist theology.
      At the conference at Regensburg (Ratisbon) in 1541, Contarini was able
      to draft a statement of the doctrine which commended itself to such
      opponents as Calvin and Eck.<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> Harnack
      has remarked that the real difference between the two doctrines appeared
      in this, that &ldquo;just on account of the doctrine of Justification the
      Protestants combated as heretical the <i>usages</i> of the Roman Church,
      while the Augustinian Thomists could not understand why it should be
      impossible to unite the two.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> But
      the similarity of statement shows the difficulty of the Legates in
      guiding the Council to frame a decree which would content the Pope.
      They were able to accomplish this mainly through the dexterity of the
      Jesuit Lainez.</p>
<p>The discussion showed how deeply the division ran. Some theologians were
      prepared to accept the purely Lutheran view that Justification was
      by Faith alone. They were in a small minority, and were noisily interrupted.
      One of them, Thomas de San Felicio, Bishop of La Cava, and a Neapolitan,
      came to blows with a Greek Bishop. The debate then centred round the
      mediating view of the doctrine, which Contarini had advocated in his <i>Tractatus
      de Justificatione</i>, and which may be said to represent the position
      of the New Thomists. It seemed to commend itself to a majority of the
      delegates. The leader of the party was Girolamo Seripando (1493-1553),
      since 1539 the General of the Augustinian Eremites, the Order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg
      578]</a></span> which Luther had belonged.<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a> He
      distinguished between an imputed and an inherent righteousness, a distinction
      corresponding to that between prevenient and co-operating grace, and
      to some extent not unlike that between Justification and Sanctification
      in later Protestant theology. In the former, the imputed righteousness
      of Christ, lay the only hope for man; inherent righteousness was based
      upon the imputed, and was useless without it. The learning and candour
      of Seripando were conspicuous; his pleading seemed about to carry the
      Council with him, when Lainez intervened to save the situation for
      the strictly papal party. The Jesuit theologian accepted the distinction
      made between imputed and inherent righteousness; he even admitted that
      the former was alone efficacious in Justification; but he alleged that
      in practice at least the two kinds of righteousness touched each other,
      and that it would be dangerous to practical theology to consider them
      as wholly distinct. His clear plausible reasoning had great effect,
      and the ambiguities of his address are reflected in the looseness of
      the definitions in the decree.</p>
<p>The definition of the doctrine of Justification which was adopted by the
      Council is very lengthy. It contains sixteen chapters followed by thirty-three
      canons. It naturally divides into three divisions&mdash;chapters i.-ix.
      describing what Justification is; chapters x.-xiii. the increase of
      Justification; and chapters xiv.&mdash;xvi. the restoration of Justification
      when it is lost. Almost every chapter includes grave ambiguities.</p>
<p>The first section is the most important. It begins with statements which
      are in themselves evangelical. All men have come under the power of
      sin, and are unable to deliver themselves either by their strength
      of nature or by the aid of the letter of the law of Moses.<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[Pg
      579]</a></span> Heavenly Father sent His Son and set Him forth as the
      propitiator through faith in His blood for our sins.<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a> It
      is then said that all do not accept the benefits of Christ&rsquo;s death,
      although He died for all, but only those to whom the merit of His passion
      is communicated; and this statement is followed by a rather confused
      sentence which suggests but commits no one to the Augustinian doctrine
      of election.<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> This
      is followed up by saying that Justification is the translation from
      that condition in which man is born into a condition of grace through
      Jesus Christ our Saviour; and it is added that this translation, in
      the Gospel dispensation, does not happen apart from Baptism or <i>the
      wish to be baptized</i>.<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> In
      spite of some ambiguities, these first four chapters have quite an
      Evangelical ring about them; but with the fifth a change begins. While
      some sentences seem to maintain the Evangelical ideas previously stated,
      room is distinctly made for Pelagian work-righteousness. It is said,
      for example, that Justification is wrought through the <i>gratia pr&aelig;veniens</i> or <i>vocatio</i> in
      which adults are called apart from any merit of their own; but then
      it is added that the end of this calling is that sinners may be <i>disposed</i>,
      by God&rsquo;s inciting and aiding grace, to <i>convert themselves</i> in
      order to their own justification by freely assenting to and co-operating
      with the grace of God.<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> This
      was the suggestion of Lainez. The good disposition into which sinners
      are to be brought is said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[Pg
      580]</a></span> consist of several things, of which the first is faith&mdash;defined
      to be a belief that the contents of the divine revelation are true.
      In the two successive chapters faith is declared to be only the beginning
      of Justification; and Justification itself, in flat contradiction to
      what had been said previously, is no longer a translation from one
      state to another; it becomes the actual and gradual conversion of a
      sinner into a righteous man. It is scarcely necessary to pursue the
      definitions further. It is sufficient to say that the theologians of
      Trent do not seem to have the faintest idea of what the Reformers meant
      by faith, and never appear to see that there is such a thing as religious
      experience.</p>
<p>The second and third sections of the decree treating of the increase of
      Justification and of its renewal in the Sacrament of Penance, were
      drafted still more emphatically in an anti-evangelical spirit, though
      here and there they show concessions to the Augustinian feeling in
      the Church. The result was that the Pope obtained what he wanted, a
      definition which made reconciliation with the Protestants impossible.
      The New Thomists were able to secure a sufficient amount of Augustinian
      theology in the decree to render Jansenism possible in the future;
      while the prevailing Pelagianism or Semi-Pelagianism foreshadowed its
      overthrow by Jesuit theology.</p>
<p>While these theological definitions were being discussed and framed, the
      Council also occupied itself with matters of reform. They began to
      make regulations about preaching and catechising, and this led them
      insensibly to the question of exemptions from episcopal control. The
      Popes had for some centuries been trying to weaken the authority of
      the Bishops, by placing the <i>regular</i> clergy or monks beyond the
      control of the Bishops within whose diocese their convents stood, and
      this exemption had been the occasion of many ecclesiastical disorders.
      The discussion was long and excited. It ended in a compromise.</p>
<p>When the decree on Justification was settled, the Council, guided by the
      Legates, proceeded to discuss the doctrine of the Sacraments, with
      the intention of still more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[Pg
      581]</a></span> thoroughly preventing any doctrinal reconciliation
      with the Protestants. This action called forth remonstrances from the
      Emperor, whose successes at the time in Germany were alarming the Pope,
      and making him anxious to withdraw the Council from Germany altogether.
      He sent orders to the Legates to endeavour to persuade the members
      at Trent to vote for a transfer to Bologna, where the papal influence
      would be stronger, and where it would be easier to pack the Synod with
      a pliant Italian majority. A pretext was found in the appearance of
      the plague at Trent; and although a strong minority, headed by Madruzzo
      of Trent, opposed the scheme, the majority (38 to 14) decided that
      they must leave Trent and establish themselves at the Italian city.
      The Spanish Bishops, however, remained at Trent awaiting the Emperor&rsquo;s
      orders.</p>
<p>Charles <span class="smcap">V.</span> had suffered many disappointments
      from the Council he had laboured to summon, and this action made him
      lose all patience. He ordered the Spanish Bishops not to leave Trent;
      the Diet of Augsburg refused to recognise the prelates who had gone
      to Bologna as the General Council. After much hesitation, Pope Paul <span class="smcap">III.</span> felt
      compelled to suspend the proceedings of the Council at Bologna (September
      17th, 1549). This ended the first part of the sittings of the Council.</p>
<h3>&sect; 4. <i>Second Meeting of the Council.</i></h3>
<p>Pope Paul <span class="smcap">III.</span> died November 10th, 1549. At
      the Conclave which followed, the Cardinal del Monte, the senior Legate
      of the Council, was chosen Pope, and took the title of Julius <span class="smcap">III.</span> (February
      7th, 1550). He and the Emperor soon came to an agreement that the Council
      should return to Trent. It accordingly reopened there on May 1st, 1551.
      The Cardinal Marcello Crescentio was appointed sole Legate, and two
      assistants, the Archbishop of Siponto and the Bishop of Verona, were
      entitled Nuncios. The second meeting of the Council did not promise
      well.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[Pg 582]</a></span> The
      Pope had agreed that something was to be done to conciliate the Protestants,
      and that it should be left an open question whether the preceding decisions
      of the Council might not be revised. But before its assembly the policy
      of the Pope again ran counter to that of the Emperor, and the Protestants
      had ceased to expect much. The delegates themselves showed little eagerness
      to come to the place of meeting. The Council was forced to adjourn,
      and it was not until the 1st of September that it began its work.</p>
<p>The earlier proceedings showed that there was little hope of conciliatory
      measures. There was no attempt to revise these former decisions, and
      the Council began its work of codifying doctrine and reformation at
      the place where it had dropped it.</p>
<p>During the later months of the first meeting, the question of the Sacraments
      had been under discussion, and so far as the second meeting is concerned
      it may be said that the whole of its theological work was confined
      to this subject.</p>
<p>Little pains were taken to conciliate the Protestants. The decisions arrived
      at pass over in contemptuous silence all the Protestant contendings.
      The relations of the Sacraments to the Word and Promises of God, and
      to the faith of the recipient, are not explained. The thirteen Canons
      which sum up the doctrine of the Sacraments in general, and the anathemas
      with which they conclude, are the protest of the Council against the
      whole Protestant movement.</p>
<p>This did not prevent the Council being confronted with great difficulties
      in their definitions&mdash;difficulties which arose from the opposition
      between the earlier and more Evangelical Thomist and the later Scotist
      and Nominalist theology. It would almost appear that the fathers of
      Trent despaired of harmonising the multitude of Scholastic theories
      on the nature of the Sacraments in general. They did not venture on
      constructing a decree, but contented themselves for the most part with
      merely negative definitions. They declare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[Pg
      583]</a></span> that there are seven Sacraments, neither more nor fewer,
      all positively instituted by Christ. They sever the intimate connection
      between faith and the Sacraments, attributing to them a secret and
      mysterious power. They practically deny the universal priesthood of
      believers (Can. 10). Perhaps the most important Canon is the last: &ldquo;If
      any one shall say that the received and approved rites of the Catholic
      Church, commonly used in the solemn administration of the Sacraments,
      may be contemned, or without sin omitted at pleasure by the ministrants,
      or be changed by any pastor of the churches into other new ones: let
      him be anathema&rdquo; (Can. 13). It enables us to see how, while not going
      beyond the verbal limits of the definitions of the Thomist theology,
      the Council provided room for subsequent aberrations of doctrine by
      raising the use and wont of the Roman Church to the level of dogma.</p>
<p>In their definitions of the single Sacraments the Council could and did
      found on the <i>Decretum pro Armenis</i> of the Council of Florence
      (1439), incorporated in the Bull <i>Exultate Deo</i> of Pope Eugenius <span class="smcap">IV.</span> The
      real substance of the definition of Baptism is found in that Canon
      (3), which declares that &ldquo;the Roman Church, which is the mother and
      mistress of all Churches, has the true doctrine of the Sacrament of
      Baptism.&rdquo; The common practice for the Bishop to confirm, an historical
      testimony to the original position of Bishops as pastors of congregations,
      is elevated to the rank of a dogma. The decree and canons on the Eucharist
      are a dexterous dove-tailing of sentences making a mosaic of differing
      scholastic theories. One detail only need concern us. Most of the theologians
      present wished the denial of the cup to the laity to be elevated into
      a dogma, and a decree was actually prepared. But the secular princes
      and a widespread public opinion made the theologians hesitate, and
      the question was settled in a late meeting (Session xxi., July 16th,
      1562) in a dexterously ambiguous way. It was declared that &ldquo;from the
      beginning of the Christian religion the use of both <i>species</i> has
      not been unfrequent,&rdquo; but it was added that no one of the laity was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[Pg
      584]</a></span> permitted to demand the cup <i>ex Dei pr&aelig;cepto</i>,
      or to believe that the Church was not acting according to just and
      weighty reasons when it was refused, or that the &ldquo;whole and entire
      Christ&rdquo; was not received &ldquo;under either species alone.&rdquo; Few statements
      have been made in such defiance of history as this decree, with its
      corresponding canons, when one and another practice of the medi&aelig;val
      Church are said to have existed from the beginning.</p>
<p>The decree on Penance is one of the most carefully constructed and least
      ambiguous. It is a real codification of Scholastic doctrine. On one
      portion only was there need for dexterous manipulation, and it received
      it. The immoral conception of <i>attrition</i> was verbally abandoned
      and really retained. <i>Contrition</i>, which is godly sorrow, is declared
      to be necessary; and <i>attrition</i> is declared to be only a salutary
      preparation. But the real distinction thus established is at once cancelled
      by calling <i>attrition</i> an <i>imperfect contrition</i>, by distinguishing
      between <i>contrition</i> itself and a more perfect <i>contrition</i>&mdash;contrition
      perfected by love; and place is provided for the reintroduction of
      the immoral conceptions of the later Scotist theologians.<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a></p>
<p>When the theological decrees and canons of the Council of Trent are read
      carefully in the light of past Scholastic controversies and of varying
      principles at work in the Roman Catholic Church of the sixteenth century,
      it is scarcely possible to avoid the conclusion that while the older
      and more Evangelical Thomist theology gained a verbal recognition,
      the real victory lay with the Scotist party now represented by the
      Jesuits. On one side of its activity, the general tendency of Scotist
      theology had been to produce what was called &ldquo;theological Scepticism&rdquo;&mdash;a
      state of mind which was compelled to dissent intellectually from most
      of the great doctrines of the medi&aelig;val Church, and at the same
      time to accept them on the external authority of the Church&mdash;to
      show that there were no really permanent principles in dogmatic, and
      that there was need everywhere for reference to a permanent and external
      source<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[Pg 585]</a></span> of
      authority who could be no other than the Roman Pontiff.</p>
<p>The Curialist position, that the Universal Church was represented by the
      Roman Church, and that the Roman Church was, as it were, condensed
      in the Pope, was not confined to the sphere of jurisdiction only. It
      had its theological side. Scripture, it was held, was to be interpreted
      according to the tradition of the Church, and the Pope alone was able
      to determine what that tradition really was. Hence, the more indefinite
      theology was, the fewer permanent principles it contained, the more
      indispensable became the papal authority, and the more thoroughly religion
      could be identified with a blind unreasoning submission to the Church
      identified as the Pope. This had been the thought of Ignatius Loyola;
      the training of the mind to such a state of absolute submission had
      been the motive in his <i>Spiritual Exercises</i> and the Jesuit theologians
      at the Council, Lainez and Salmeron, did very much to secure the practical
      victory won by Scotist theology, in spite of the fact that the phrases
      of the decrees came from the theology of their opponents.</p>
<p>The second meeting of the Council of Trent ended on April 28th, 1552.
      The Peace of Augsburg (1555) showed that the Protestants had acquired
      a separate legal standing within the Empire, and most people thought
      that the work of the Council had been wasted. Things were as if it
      had never been in existence. Pope Paul <span class="smcap">III.</span> died
      on March 24th, 1555, and the Conclave elected Cervini, who took the
      title of Marcellus <span class="smcap">II.</span> The new Pope survived
      his elevation only three weeks. He was succeeded by Cardinal Caraffa,
      Paul <span class="smcap">IV.</span>, and the Counter-Reformation began
      in earnest.</p>
<p>Paul <span class="smcap">IV.</span>, hater of Spaniards as he was, was
      the embodiment of the Spanish idea of what a reformation should be.
      He believed that the work of reform could be done better by the Pope
      himself than by any Council, and he set to work with the thoroughness
      which characterised him. There was to be no tampering with the doctrines,
      usages, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[Pg
      586]</a></span> institutions of the medi&aelig;val Church. Heresy and
      Schism were to be crushed by the Inquisition, and the spread of new
      ideas was to be prevented by the strict examination of all books, and
      the destruction of those which contained what the Pope conceived to
      be unwholesome for the minds or morals of mankind. But the Church needed
      to be reformed thoroughly; the lives of the clergy, and especially
      of the higher clergy, had to be amended; and abuses which had crept
      into administration had to be set right.</p>
<p>For some time any real reformation was retarded by the influence of his
      nephews, who played on the old Pontiff&rsquo;s hatred of the Spaniards, and
      easily persuaded him that his first duty was to expel the Spaniards
      from the Italian peninsula. But the evil deeds of these near kinsmen
      gradually reached his ears. In an assembly of the Inquisition, held
      in 1559, he was told by Cardinal Pacheco that &ldquo;reform must begin with <i>us</i>.&rdquo; The
      old man retired to his apartments, instituted a searching inquiry into
      the conduct of his nephews, and within a month had deprived them of
      all their offices and emoluments, and banished them from Rome. Free
      from this family embarrasment, the Pope prosecuted vigorously his plans
      for reformation. The secular administration of the States of the Church
      was thoroughly purified. A Congregation was appointed to examine, classify,
      and remedy ecclesiastical abuses. Many of the abuses of the Curia were
      swept away. The Jesuits taught him, although he had no great love for
      the Order, that spiritual services should not be sold for money. He
      prohibited taking fees for marriage dispensations. He was a stern censor
      of the morals of the higher clergy. Under his brief rule Rome became
      respectable if not virtuous. He restored some of the privileges of
      the Bishops which had been absorbed by the Papacy. All the while his
      zeal for purity of doctrine made him urge on the Inquisition and the
      Index to use their terrible powers. He spared no one. Cardinal Morone,
      one of the few survivals of the liberal Roman Catholics, was imprisoned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[Pg
      587]</a></span> and the suppression of all liberal ideas was sternly
      prosecuted.<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a></p>
<h3>&sect; 5. <i>Third Meeting of the Council.</i></h3>
<p>Paul <span class="smcap">IV.</span> died on the 18th of August 1559. He
      was succeeded by Giovanni de&rsquo; Medici (Dec. 26th, 1559), a man of a
      very different type of character, who took the title of Pius <span class="smcap">IV.</span> The
      new Pope was by training a lawyer rather than a theologian, and a man
      skilled in diplomacy. He recognised, as none of his predecessors had
      done, the difficulties which confronted the Church of Rome. The Lutheran
      Church had won political recognition in Germany. Scandinavia and Denmark
      were hopelessly lost. England had become Protestant, and Scotland was
      almost sure to follow the example of her more powerful neighbour. The
      Low Countries could not be coerced by Philip and Alva. More than half
      of German Switzerland had declared for the Reformation. Geneva had
      become a Protestant fortress, and Calvin&rsquo;s opinions were gaming ground
      all over French Switzerland. France was hopelessly divided. Bohemia,
      Hungary, and Poland were alienated from Rome, and might soon revolt
      altogether. The Pope was convinced that a General Council was necessary
      to reunite the forces still on the side of the Roman Catholic Church.
      He saw that it was vain to expect to do this without coming to terms
      with the Romanist sovereigns. It was the age of autocracy. He pleaded
      for an alliance of autocrats to confront and withstand the Protestant
      revolution. He tried to persuade the Emperor (now Ferdinand), Francis <span class="smcap">II.</span> of
      France, and Philip of Spain that the independent rule of Bishops was
      one side of the feudalism which was hostile to monarchy, and that the
      Pope and the Kings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[Pg
      588]</a></span> ought to work together. His representations had some
      effect as time went on.</p>
<p>A papal Bull (Nov. 29th, 1560) summoned a Council at Trent on April 6th,
      1561. Five Legates were appointed to preside, at their head Ercole
      di Gonzaga, Cardinal of Mantua. They reached Trent on the 16th of April
      (1561), and were received by Ludovico Madruzzo, who had succeeded his
      uncle, the Cardinal, in the bishopric. The delegates came slowly. The
      first session (xvii<sup>th</sup>) was not held till Jan. 18th, 1562,
      and was unimportant. The real work began at the second session (xviii<sup>th</sup>),
      held on Feb. 26th (1562).</p>
<p>The Protestants had been invited to attend, but it was well known that
      they would not; the assembly represented the Roman Catholic Powers,
      and them alone. Its object was not to conciliate the Protestants, but
      to organise the Romanist Church. The various Roman Catholic Powers,
      however, had different ideas of what ought to be involved in such a
      reorganisation.</p>
<p>The Emperor knew that there were many lukewarm Protestants on the one
      hand and many disaffected Romanists on the other. He believed that
      the former could be won back and the latter confirmed by some serious
      modifications in the usages of the Church. His scheme of reform, set
      down in his instructions to his Ambassadors, was very extensive. It
      included the permission to give the cup to the laity, marriage of the
      priests, mitigation of the prescribed fasts, the use of some of the
      ecclesiastical revenues to provide schools for the poor, a revision
      of the service books in the sense of purging them of many of their
      legends, singing German hymns in public worship, the publication of
      a good and simple catechism for the instruction of the young, a reformation
      of the cloisters, and a reduction of the powers of the Roman Pontiff
      according to the ideas of the Council of Constance. These reforms,
      earnestly pressed by the Emperor in letters, had the support of almost
      all the German Roman Catholics.</p>
<p>The French Bishops, headed by the Cardinal Lorraine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[Pg
                  589]</a></span> supported the German demands. They were
                  especially anxious for the granting the cup to the laity,
                  the administration of the Sacraments in French, French
                  hymns snug in public worship, and that the celebration
                  of the Mass should always be accompanied by instruction
                  and a sermon. They also pressed for a limitation of the
                  powers of the Pope, according to the decisions of the Council
                  of Basel.</p>
<p>The Spanish Bishops, on the other hand, were thoroughly opposed to any
      change in ecclesiastical doctrine or usages. They did not wish the
      cup given to the laity; they abhorred clerical marriage; they protested
      against the idea of the services or any part of them in the mother
      tongue. But they desired a thorough reformation of the Curia, of the
      whole system of dispensations; they wished a limitation of the powers
      of the Pope, and to see the Bishops of the Church restored to their
      ancient privileges.</p>
<p>France and Germany desired that the Council should be considered a new
      Synod; Spain and the Pope meant it to be simply a continuation of the
      former sessions at Trent.</p>
<p>These difficulties might well have daunted the Pope; but the suave diplomatist
      faced the situation, trusting mainly to his own abilities to carry
      matters through to a successful issue. He knew that he must have command
      of the Council, and to that end several resolutions were passed mainly
      by the adroit generalship of the Legates. It was practically, if not
      formally, resolved that the Synod should be simply a continuation of
      that Council which had begun at Trent in 1545. This got rid at once
      of a great deal of difficult doctrinal discussion, and provided that
      all dogmas had to be discussed on the lines laid down in previous sessions.
      It was decreed that no proxies should be allowed. This enabled the
      Pope to keep up a constant majority of Italian Bishops, who outnumbered
      those of all other nations put together. By a clever ruse the Council
      was induced to vote that the papal Legates alone should have the privilege
      of proposing resolutions to the Council.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[Pg
      590]</a></span> This made it impossible to bring before the Council
      any matter to which the Pope had objection.</p>
<p>The Pope knew well, however, that it mattered little what conclusions
      the Council came to, if its decisions were to be repudiated by the
      Roman Catholic Powers. He therefore carried on elaborate negotiations
      with the Emperor and the Kings of Spain and France while the Council
      was sitting, and arranged with them the wording of the decrees to be
      adopted. His tactics, which never varied during the whole period of
      the Council, and which were finally crowned with success, were simple.
      He maintained at all costs a numerical majority in the Synod ready
      to vote as he directed. This was done by systematic drafts of Italian
      Bishops to Trent. Many of the poorer ones were subsidised through Cardinal
      Simonetta, whose business it was to see that the mechanical majority
      was kept up, and to direct it how to vote. His Legates had the exclusive
      right of proposing resolutions; couriers took the proposals drafted
      by the various Congregations to Rome, and the Pope revised them there
      before they were laid before the whole Council to be voted upon; spies
      informed him what were the objections of the French, Spanish, or German
      Bishops, and the Pope was diligent to bring all manner of influences
      to bear upon them to incline them to his mind; if he failed, he prevented
      the proposals being laid before the Council until he had consulted
      and bargained with the monarchs through special agents. The papal post-bags,
      containing proposed decrees or canons, went the round of the European
      Courts before they were presented to the Council, and the Bishops spoke
      and voted upon what had been already settled behind their backs and
      without their knowledge.</p>
<p>In spite of all this dexterous manipulation, the Council, composed of
      so many jarring elements, did not work very smoothly. The papal diplomacy
      sometimes increased the disturbances. Men chafed under the thought
      that they were only puppets, and that the matters they had been called
      together to discuss were already irrevocably settled.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[Pg 591]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Better never to have come here at all,&rdquo; said a Spanish Bishop, &ldquo;than
      to be reduced to mere spectators.&rdquo; Few ecclesiastical assemblies have
      seen stormier scenes than took place during these later sittings of
      the Council of Trent.</p>
<p>In the end, the papal diplomacy prevailed. His conciliatory manner helped
      Pius through difficulties in which another would have failed. No man
      was readier to give way in things which he did not consider essential,
      and what he promised he scrupulously performed. The success of the
      last meeting of the Council was due to bargaining and dexterous persuasion.
      When the critical point arrived, and it seemed as if the Council must
      fall to pieces, his agents, Morone and Peter Canisius, the great German
      Jesuit, won Ferdinand over to the Pope&rsquo;s side. Similar persuasive diplomacy
      secured the influence of the Cardinal of Lorraine. Even Philip of Spain
      was brought to see that the Spanish Bishops were asking too much.</p>
<p>It must also be remembered that while Pius <span class="smcap">IV.</span> refused
      to tolerate any loss of papal rights or privileges, he consented to
      and did his best to carry out numberless salutary reforms; and that
      the Council of Trent not only reorganised, but greatly purified the
      Roman Church. Almost all that was good in the reformation wrought by
      his predecessor Paul <span class="smcap">IV.</span> was made part of
      the Tridentine regulations.</p>
<p>The special matter in dispute between the Pope and the great majority
      of non-Italian Bishops concerned the relations in which the Bishops
      of the Catholic Church stood to the Bishop of Rome, whom all acknowledged
      as their head. The Spanish, French, and German Bishops were strongly
      opposed to that doctrine of papal supremacy which had been assiduously
      taught by the canonists of the Roman Curia for at least two centuries,
      and which was called <i>curialism</i>. Curialism taught that the Pope
      was lord of the Church in the sense that all the clergy were his servants,
      and that Bishops in particular were mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[Pg
      592]</a></span> assistants whom he had appointed for the purpose of
      oversight to act as his vicars. Whatever powers of jurisdiction they
      possessed came from him, and from him alone. The opposite conception,
      that insisted on at Trent by the northern and Spanish Bishops, that
      maintained at the great Councils of Constance and Basel, was that every
      Bishop had his power directly from Christ, and that the Pope, while
      he was the representative of the unity of the Church, and therefore
      to be recognised as its head, was only a <i>primus inter pares</i>,
      and subject to the episcopate as a whole in Council assembled. The
      question kept cropping up in almost all the discussions in the Council
      which turned on reform. It began as early as the fifth session (June
      17th, 1546) and went on intermittently; but it positively raged in
      the later sessions.</p>
<p>The question was raised on its practical side. One of the standing abuses
      in the medi&aelig;val Church was the non-residence of Bishops. The
      Council was passionately called upon by the Spanish and northern Bishops
      to declare that residence was a necessary thing, and unanimously responded
      that it was. Their function was the oversight of their dioceses, and
      this could only be done when they were resident. But how was this to
      be enforced? To compel the Bishops to reside within their dioceses
      would depopulate the Court of Rome, and make it very much poorer. Bishops
      from every country in Europe were attached to the Roman Court, and
      their stipends, drawn from the countries in which their Sees lay, were
      spent in Rome, and aided the magnificence of the papal entourage. The
      reformers felt that a theoretical question lay behind the practical,
      and insisted that the oversight and therefore the residence of Bishops
      was <i>de jure divino</i> and not merely <i>de lege ecclesiastica</i>&mdash;something
      enjoined by God, and therefore beyond alteration by the Pope. Behind
      this lay the thought, first introduced by Cyprian, that every Bishop
      was within his congregation or diocese the Vicar of Christ, and in
      the last resort responsible to Him alone. Thus the old conciliar conception,
      maintained at Constance and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[Pg
      593]</a></span> Basel, faced the curial at Trent; and both were too
      powerful to give way entirely. In spite of his Italian majority, the
      Pope could not get a majority for a direct negative denying the <i>de
      jure divino</i> theory. At the final vote, sixty-six fathers declared
      for the <i>de jure divino</i> theory, while seventy-one either rejected
      it altogether or voted for remitting it to the decision of the Pope.
      The Pope dared not make use of the liberty of decision thus accorded
      to him by a majority of five. If he did he would then be left to face
      the European Roman Catholic Courts of Germany, France, and Spain&mdash;all
      of whom supported the conciliar view. Thus the theoretical question
      was left undecided at Trent, but the papal diplomacy prevailed to the
      extent of creating a bias in favour of curialist ideas, which left
      the Pope in a stronger position as regards the episcopate than any
      other General Council had ever placed him in.</p>
<p>The prominence given to the <i>Roman</i> (<i>i.e.</i> the papal) Church
      throughout the decisions of the Council, beginning with the way in
      which the Constantinopolitan (Nicene) Creed was affirmed;<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> the
      insertion of the phrase <i>His own Vicar upon earth</i>;<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> the
      injunction that Patriarchs, Primates, Archbishops, Bishops, and all
      others who of right and custom ought to be present at a provincial
      council ... <i>promise and profess true obedience to the Sovereign
      Roman Pontiff</i>;<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> the
      10th clause in the <i>Professio Fidei Tridentin&aelig;</i>: &ldquo;I acknowledge
      the holy Catholic Apostolic Roman Church for the mother and mistress
      of all Churches; and I promise and swear true obedience to the Bishop
      of Rome, successor to St. Peter, Prince of Apostles, and Vicar of Jesus
      Christ&rdquo;; the way in which the Council at its last session (Dec. 4th,
      1563) left entirely in the Pope&rsquo;s hands the confirmation of its decrees
      and the measures to be used for carrying them out; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[Pg
      594]</a></span> above all its calm acquiescence in the Bull <i>Benedictus
      Deus</i> (Jan. 24th, 1564), in which Pope Pius <span class="smcap">IV.</span> reserved
      the exposition of its decrees to himself<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a>&mdash;all
      testify to the triumph of curialist ideas at the Council of Trent.
      The Roman Catholic Church had become, in a sense never before universally
      accepted, the &ldquo;Pope&rsquo;s House.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This Council, so eagerly demanded, so greatly protracted, twice dissolved,
      buffeted by storms in the political world, exposed, even in its later
      sessions, to many a danger, ended in the general contentment of the
      Roman Catholic peoples. When the prelates met together for the last
      time on the 4th of December 1563, ancient opponents embraced, and traces
      of tears were seen in many of the old eyes.</p>
<p>It had done three things for the Roman Catholic Church. It had provided
      a compact system of doctrine, stript of many of the vagaries of Scholasticism,
      and yet opposed to Protestant teaching. Romanism had an intellectual
      basis of its own to rest on. It had rebuilt the hierarchy on what may
      be called almost a new foundation, and made it symmetrical. It had
      laid down a scheme of reformation which, if only carried out by succeeding
      Pontiffs, would free the Church from many of the crying evils which
      had given such strength to the Protestant movement. It had insisted
      on and made provisions for an educated clergy&mdash;perhaps the greatest
      need of the Roman Church in the middle of the sixteenth century.</p>
<p>All this was largely due to the man who ruled in Rome. Pope Pius <span class="smcap">IV.</span>,
      sprung from the shrewd Italian middle-class,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[Pg
      595]</a></span> caring little for theology, by no means distinguished
      for piety, had seen what the Church needed, and by deft diplomacy had
      obtained it. A stronger man would have snapped the threads which tied
      all parties together; one more zealous would have lacked his infinite
      patience; a deeply pious man could scarcely have employed the means
      he continually used. He was magnificently assisted by the new Company
      of Jesus. No theologians had so much influence at Trent as Lainez and
      Salmeron; the Council would have broken down altogether but for the
      aid given by Canisius to Morone in his negotiations with the Emperor.</p>
<p>Pius <span class="smcap">IV.</span> was not slow to fulfil the promises
      he had made to sovereigns and Council. The Breviary and the Missal
      were revised, as Ferdinand had requested. Ecclesiastical music was
      purified. Exertions were made to establish colleges and theological
      seminaries. But a sterner Pontiff was needed to guide the battle against
      the growing Protestantism. He was found in the next, Pope Pius <span class="smcap">V.</span></p>
<p>The influence of Cardinal Borromeo, the pious nephew of Pius <span class="smcap">IV.</span>,
      was powerful in the Conclave, and was exerted to procure the election
      of Michele Ghislieri, Cardinal of Alessandria, who took the name of
      Pius <span class="smcap">V.</span> The new Pontiff had entered a Dominican
      convent when fourteen years of age, and had given himself up heart
      and soul to the strictest life his Order enjoined. He had all the zeal
      for strict orthodoxy which characterised the Dominicans, an asceticism
      which never spared himself, and a detestation of the immoralities and
      irregularities which too often disgraced the lives of ecclesiastics.
      He carried the habits of the cloister with him into the Vatican. He
      never missed attendance at the prescribed services of the Church, and
      in his devotion there was no trace of hypocrisy. He was a Pope to lead
      the new Romanism, with its intense hatred of heresy, its determination
      to reform the moral life, and its contempt for the Renaissance and
      all its works. Philip <span class="smcap">II.</span> of Spain sent
      a special letter of congratulation to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[Pg
      596]</a></span> Cardinal Borromeo to thank him for his efforts in the
      Conclave.</p>
<p>The new Pontiff believed, heart and soul, in repression. He meant to fight
      the Reformation by the Inquisition and the Index; and these two instruments
      were unsparingly used.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<h3>THE INQUISITION AND THE INDEX.<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a></h3>
<h3>&sect; 1. <i>The Inquisition in Spain.</i></h3>
<p>The idea conveyed in the term Inquisition is the punishment of spiritual
      or ecclesiastical offences by physical pains and penalties. It was
      no new conception in the Christian Church. It had existed from the
      days of Constantine. So far as the medi&aelig;val Church is concerned,
      historians roughly distinguish between the Episcopal, the Papal, and
      the Spanish Inquisitions. In the half-barbarous Church of the early
      Middle Ages, in which a curious give-and-take policy existed between
      the secular and civil powers, a seemingly consistent understanding
      was arrived at between Church and State, which may be summed up by
      saying that it was recognised to be the Church&rsquo;s duty to point out
      heretics, and that of the State to punish them&mdash;the Church being
      represented by the Bishops. This episcopal Inquisition took many forms,
      and was never a very effective instrument in the suppression of heresy.</p>
<p>In 1203, Pope Innocent <span class="smcap">III.</span>, alarmed at the
      spread of heresies through southern France and northern Italy, published
      a Bull censuring the indifference of the Bishops, appointing the Abbot
      of Citeaux his delegate in matters of heresy, and giving him power
      to judge and <i>punish</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[Pg
      598]</a></span> heresy. This was the beginning of the Inquisition as
      a separate institution. It was an act of papal centralisation, and
      a distinct encroachment on the episcopal jurisdiction. The papal Inquisition,
      thus started, took root. It did not displace the old episcopal Inquisition;
      the two existed side by side; but the &ldquo;Apostolic Tribunal for the suppression
      of heresy&rdquo; was by far the more effective weapon. It was usually managed
      by the Dominican and Franciscan Orders.</p>
<p>The Spanish Inquisition took its rise in the closing decades of the fifteenth
      century. The Popes had frequently desired to see the papal Inquisition
      introduced into Spain, and leave had always been refused by the sovereigns,
      jealous of papal interference. Pope Sixtus <span class="smcap">IV.</span> had
      gone the length of granting to his Legate, Nicolo Franco, &ldquo;full inquisitorial
      powers to prosecute and punish false Christians who after baptism persisted
      in the observance of Jewish rites,&rdquo; but Isabella and Ferdinand did
      not allow him to exercise them. But the power and wealth of the <i>Conversos</i>&mdash;Jews
      who had nominally embraced Christianity&mdash;had made them detested
      by the Spanish people, and a large section of the clergy were clamouring
      for their overthrow. Thomas de Torquemada, the Queen&rsquo;s confessor, eagerly
      pressed the Inquisition upon his royal penitent, and at last the sovereigns
      applied to the Pope for a Bull to enable them to establish in Spain
      an Inquisition of a peculiar kind. It was to differ from the ordinary
      papal Inquisition in this, that it was to be strictly under royal control,
      that the sovereigns were to have the appointment of the Inquisitors,
      and that the fines and confiscations were to flow into the royal treasury.
      The Bull was granted (November 1st, 1478), but the sovereigns hesitated
      to use the rights it conveyed. After a year&rsquo;s delay, two royal Inquisitors
      were appointed (September 17th, 1480), and the first <i>auto-da-f&eacute;</i>,
      at which six persons were burnt, took place on February 6th, 1481.
      The succeeding years saw various modifications in the constitution
      of the Holy Office; but at last it was organised with a council, presided
      over by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[Pg 599]</a></span> an
      Inquisitor-General, Thomas de Torquemada. He was a man of pitiless
      zeal, stern, relentless, and autocratic; and he stamped his nature
      on the institution over which he presided. The Holy Office was permitted
      to frame its own rules. The permission made it practically independent,
      while all the resources of the State were placed at its command. When
      an Inquisitor came to assume his functions, the officials took an oath
      to assist him to exterminate all whom he might designate as heretics,
      and to observe, and compel the observance by all, of the decretals <i>Ad
      abolendum, Excommunicamus, Ut officium Inquisitionis</i>, and <i>Ut
      Inquisitionis negotium</i>&mdash;the papal legislation of the thirteenth
      century, which made the State wholly subservient to the Holy Office,
      and rendered incapable of official position any one suspect in the
      faith or who favoured heretics. Besides this, all the population was
      assembled to listen to a sermon by the Inquisitor, after which all
      were required to swear on the cross and the Gospels to help the Holy
      Office, and not to impede it in any manner or on any pretext. The methods
      of work and procedure were also taken from the papal Inquisition. The
      Inquisitors were furnished with letters patent. They travelled from
      town to town, attended by guards and notaries public. Their expenses
      were defrayed by taxes laid on the towns and districts through which
      they passed. Spies and informers, guaranteed State protection, brought
      forward their information. The Court was opened; witnesses were examined;
      and the accused were acquitted or found guilty. The sentence was pronounced;
      the secular assessor gave a formal assent; and the accused was handed
      over to the civil authorities for punishment. When Torquemada reorganised
      the Spanish Inquisition, a series of rules were framed for its procedure
      which enforced secrecy to the extent of depriving the accused of any
      rational means of defence; which elaborated the judicial method so
      as to leave no loop-hole even for those who expressed a wish to recant;
      and which multiplied the charges under which suspected heretics, even
      after death, might be treated as impenitent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[Pg
      600]</a></span> and their property confiscated. The Spanish Inquisition
      differed from the papal in its close relation to the civil authorities,
      its terrible secrecy, its relentlessness, and its exclusion of Bishops
      from even a nominal participation in its work. Thus organised, it became
      the most terrible of curses to unhappy Spain. During the first hundred
      and thirty-nine years of its existence the country was depopulated
      to the extent of three millions of people. It had become strong enough
      to overawe the monarchy, to insult the episcopate, and to defy the
      Pope. The number of its victims can only be conjectured. Llorente has
      calculated that during the eighteen years of Torquemada&rsquo;s presidency
      114,000 persons were accused, of whom 10,220 were burnt alive, and
      97,000 were condemned to perpetual imprisonment or to public penitence.
      This was the terrible instrument used relentlessly to bring the Spanish
      people into conformity with the Spanish Reformation, and to crush the
      growing Protestantism of the Low Countries. It was extended to Corsica
      and Sardinia; but the people of Naples and Sicily successfully resisted
      its introduction when proposed by the Spanish Viceroys.</p>
<h3>&sect; 2. <i>The Inquisition in Italy.</i></h3>
<p>Cardinal Caraffa (afterwards Pope Paul <span class="smcap">IV.</span>),
      the relentless enemy of the Reformation, seeing the success of this
      Spanish Inquisition in its extermination of heretics, induced Pope
      Paul <span class="smcap">III.</span> to consent to a reorganisation
      of the papal Inquisition in Italy on the Spanish model, in 1542. The
      Curia had become alarmed at the progress of the Reformation in Italy.
      They had received information that small Protestant communities had
      been formed in several of the Italian towns, and that heresy was spreading
      in an alarming fashion. Caraffa declared that &ldquo;the whole of Italy was
      infected with the Lutheran heresy, which had been extensively embraced
      both by statesmen and ecclesiastics.&rdquo;
      Ignatius Loyola and the Jesuits highly approved of the suggestion,
      and they were all-powerful with the Cardinal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[Pg
      601]</a></span> Borromeo, the pious and trusted nephew of the Pope.
      In 1542 the Congregation of the Holy Office was founded at Rome, and
      six Cardinals, among them Cardinals Caraffa and Toledo, were named
      Inquisitors-General, with authority on both sides of the Alps to try
      all cases of heresy, to apprehend and imprison suspected persons, and
      to appoint inferior tribunals with the same or more limited powers.
      The intention was to introduce into this remodelled papal Inquisition
      most of the features which marked the thoroughness of the Spanish institution.
      But the jealousy of the Popes prevented the Holy Office from exercising
      the same independent action in Italy as in Spain. The new institution
      began its work at once within the States of the Church, and was introduced
      after some negotiations into most of the Italian principalities. Venice
      refused, until it was arranged that the Holy Office there should be
      strictly subject to the civil authorities.</p>
<p>Although modelled on the Spanish institution, the work of the Holy Office
      in Italy never exhibited the same murderous activity; nor was there
      the same need. The Italians have never showed the stern consistency
      in faith which characterised the Spaniards. It was generally found
      sufficient to strike at the leaders in order to cause the relapse of
      their followers. Still the records of the Office and contemporary witnesses
      recount continuous trials and burnings in Rome and in other cities.
      In Venice, death by drowning was substituted for burning. The victims
      were placed on a board supported by two gondolas; the boats were rowed
      apart, and the unfortunate martyrs perished in the waters. The Protestant
      congregations which had been formed in Bologna, Faenza, Ferrara, Lucca,
      Modena, Naples, Siena, Venice, and Vicenza were dispersed with little
      or no bloodshed. A colony of Waldenses, settled near the town of Cosenza
      in the north-central part of Calabria, were made of sterner stuff.
      Nothing would induce them to relapse, and they were exterminated by
      sword, by hurling from the summits of cliffs, by prolonged confinement
      in deadly prisons, at the stake, in the mines,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[Pg
      602]</a></span> in the Spanish galleys. One hundred elderly women were
      first tortured and then slaughtered at Montalto. The survivors among
      the women and children were sold into slavery. Such was the work of
      the Counter-Reformation in Italy, and the measures to which it owed
      much of its success.</p>
<h3>&sect; 3. <i>The Index.</i></h3>
<p>Leaders of the Counter-Reformation in Italy like Popes Paul <span class="smcap">IV.</span> and
      Pius <span class="smcap">V.</span> were determined on much more than
      the dispersion of Protestant communities and the banishment or martyrdom
      of the missionaries of Evangelical thought. They resolved to destroy
      what they rightly enough believed to be its seed and seed-bed&mdash;the
      cultivation of independent thinking and of impartial scholarship. They
      wished to extirpate all traces of the Renaissance. In the fifteenth
      and first half of the sixteenth centuries, Italy had been &ldquo;the workshop
      of ideas,&rdquo; the <i>officina scientiarum</i> for the rest of Europe.
      The Inquisition, in Italy as in Spain, attacked the Academies, the
      schools of learning, above all the libraries in which the learning
      of the past was stored, and the printing-presses which disseminated
      ideas day by day. They had the example of Torquemada before them, who
      had burnt six thousand volumes at Salamanca in 1490 on pretence that
      they taught sorcery.</p>
<p>It was no new thing to order the burning of heretical writings. This had
      been done continuously throughout the Middle Ages. The episcopal Inquisition,
      the Universities, the papal Inquisition, had all endeavoured to discover
      and destroy writings which they deemed to be dangerous to the dogmas
      of the Church. After the invention of printing such a method of slaying
      ideas was not so easy; but the ecclesiastical authorities had tried
      their best. The celebrated edict of the Archbishop of Mainz of 1486,
      prompted by the number of Bibles printed in the vernacular, and trying
      to establish a censorship of books, may be taken as an example.<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a></p>
<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[Pg 603]</a></p>
<p>Pope Sixtus <span class="smcap">IV.</span> in 1547 had ordered the University
      of K&ouml;ln to see that no books (<i>libri, tractatus aut scriptur&aelig;
      qualescunque</i>) were printed without previous licence, and had empowered
      the authorities to inflict penalties on the printers, purchasers, and
      readers of all unlicensed books. Alexander <span class="smcap">VI.</span> had
      sent the same order to the Archbishops of K&ouml;ln, Mainz, Trier,
      and Magdeburg (1501). In a <i>Constitution</i> of Leo <span class="smcap">X.</span>,
      approved by the Lateran Council of 1515, it was declared that no book
      could be printed in Rome which had not been expressly sanctioned by
      the <i>Master of the Palace</i>, and in other lands by the Bishop of
      the diocese or the Inquisitor of the district; and this had been homologated
      by the Council of Trent.<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> From
      its reorganisation in 1543 the papal Inquisition in Rome had undertaken
      this work of censorship.</p>
<p>Outside the States of the Church the suppression of books and the requirement
      of ecclesiastical licence could only be carried out through the co-operation
      of the secular authorities; and they naturally demanded some uniformity
      in the books condemned. This led to lists of prohibited books being
      drawn up&mdash;as at Louvain (1546 and 1550), at K&ouml;ln (1549),
      and by the Sorbonne, who managed the Inquisition for the north of France
      (1544 and 1551). Pope Paul <span class="smcap">IV.</span> drafted the
      first papal Index in 1559. It was very drastic, and its very severity
      prevented its success.<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> It
      was this <i>Index Librorum Prohibitorum</i> which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[Pg
      604]</a></span> was discussed by the Commission appointed at the Council
      of Trent.<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a></p>
<p>The Commission drafted a set of ten rules to be followed in constructing
      a list of prohibited books, and left the actual formation of the Index
      to the Pope. This new Index (the Tridentine Index) was published by
      Pope Pius <span class="smcap">IV.</span> in 1564. His successor, Pius <span class="smcap">V.</span>,
      appointed a special Commission of Cardinals to deal with the question
      of prohibited books. It was called the Congregation of the Index, and
      although distinct from the Inquisition, worked along with it. Its work
      was done very thoroughly. Italian scholarship was slain so far as the
      peninsula was concerned. The scholarship of Spain and Portugal was
      also destroyed. Learning had to take shelter north of the Alps and
      the Pyrenees. So thoroughly was the work of prohibition carried out,
      so many difficulties beset even Roman Catholic authors, that Paleario
      called the whole system &ldquo;a dagger drawn from the scabbard to assassinate
      all men of letters&rdquo;; Paul Sarpi dubbed it &ldquo;the finest secret which
      has ever been discovered for applying religion to the purpose of making
      men idiots&rdquo;; and Latini, a champion of the Papacy, declared it to be
      a &ldquo;peril which threatened the very existence of books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rules for framing the Index, drafted by the commission of the Council
      of Trent, are curious reading. The writings of noted Reformers, of
      Zwingli, Luther, and especially of Calvin, were absolutely prohibited.
      The Vulgate was to be the only authorised version of the Scriptures,
      and the only one to be quoted as an inspired text. Scholars might,
      by special permission of their ecclesiastical superiors, possess another
      version, but they were never to quote it as authoritative. Versions
      in the vernacular were never to be quoted. Bible Dictionaries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[Pg
      605]</a></span> Concordances, books on controversial theology, had
      to pass the strictest examination at the hands of the censors before
      publication. The censors were directed to examine with the utmost care
      not merely the text, but all summaries, notes, indexes, prefaces, and
      dedications, searching for any heretical phrases or for sentences which
      the unwary might be tempted to think heretical, for all criticisms
      on any ecclesiastical action, for any satire on the clergy or on religious
      rites. All such passages were to be expunged.</p>
<p>North of the Alps the Index had small effect. It was impotent in lands
      where the Reformation was firmly established; and in France, papal
      Germany, and north Italy a class of daring colporteurs carried the
      prohibited tracts, Bibles, and religious literature throughout the
      lands.</p>
<p>The tremendous powers of suppression set forth in the Tridentine rules
      could not avoid doing infinite mischief to thought and scholarship,
      even if placed in the hands of qualified and well-intentioned men.
      But the censors were neither capable nor high-minded. Scholars refused
      the odious task. Commentaries on the Fathers were read by men who knew
      little Latin, less Greek, and no Hebrew. They were discovered extorting
      money from unfortunate authors, levying blackmail on booksellers, listening
      to the whispers of jealous rivals.</p>
<p>So effectually was learning slain in Italy, that when the Popes at the
      close of the sixteenth century strove to revive the scholarship of
      the Church and to gather together at Rome a band of men able to defend
      the Papacy with their pens, these scholars had to work under immense
      disabilities. Baronius wrote his <i>Annals</i>, and Latini edited the
      Latin Fathers, both of them ignorant of Greek, and both harassed by
      the censorship.</p>
<p>Some of the more distinguished leaders of the Counter-Reformation saw
      the dangers which lurked in this system of pure suppression. The great
      German Jesuit, Canisius, who did more than any other man for the maintenance
      and revival of the Roman Catholic Church in Germany,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[Pg
      606]</a></span> pointed out that destruction was powerless to effect
      permanent good. The people must have books, and the Church ought to
      supply them. He laboured somewhat successfully to that end.</p>
<h3>&sect; 4. <i>The Society of Jesus and the Counter-Reformation.</i></h3>
<p>Neither the Inquisition nor the Index account for the Counter-Reformation.
      Repression might stamp out Reformers in southern Europe; but faith,
      enthusiasm, unselfish and self-denying work were needed to enable the
      Roman Church to assume the offensive. These were supplied to a large
      extent by the devoted followers of Ignatius Loyola.</p>
<p>Roman Catholicism reached its ebb during the pontificate of Pius <span class="smcap">IV.</span> It
      stood everywhere on the defensive, seeing one stronghold after another
      pass into the hands of a victorious Protestantism. Pius <span class="smcap">V.</span>,
      his successor, was the first fighting Pope of the new Roman Catholicism.
      He had behind him the reorganisation effected by the Council of Trent;
      the Roman Catholic revival of medi&aelig;val piety of which Carlo Borromeo,
      Philip Neri, and Francis de Sales were distinguished types; the Inquisition
      and Congregation of the Index; and, above all, the Company of Jesus.
      Romanism under his leadership boldly assumed the offensive.</p>
<p>In 1564 it seemed as if all Germany might become Protestant. The States
      which still acknowledged the Papacy were honeycombed with Protestant
      communities. Bavaria, the Rhine Provinces, the Duchy of Austria itself,
      were, according to contemporary accounts, more than half-Protestant.
      Nearly all the seats of learning were Protestant. The Romanist Universities
      of Vienna and Ingolstadt were almost deserted by students. Under the
      skilful and enthusiastic leadership of Peter Canisius, the Jesuits
      were mainly instrumental in changing this state of things. They entered
      Bavaria and Austria. They appeared there as the heralds and givers
      of education, and took possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[Pg
      607]</a></span> of the rising generation. They established their schools
      in all the principal centres of population. They were good teachers;
      they produced school-books of a modern type; the catechism written
      by Canisius himself was used in all their schools (it transplanted
      into Romanism the Lutheran system of catechising); they charged no
      fees; they soon had the instruction of the Roman Catholic children
      in their hands. The astonished people of town and country districts
      began to see pilgrimages of boys and girls, conducted like modern Sunday-school
      treats, led by the good fathers, to visit famous churches, shrines,
      holy crosses, miraculous wells, etc. The parents were induced to visit
      the teachers; visits led to the confessional, and the confessional
      to the directorate. Then followed the discipline of the <i>Spiritual
      Exercises</i>, usually shortened to suit the capacities of the penitents.
      Whole districts were led back to the confessional&mdash;the parents
      following the children.</p>
<p>The higher education was not neglected. Jesuit colleges founded at Vienna
      and Ingolstadt peopled the decaying universities with students, and
      gave them new life. Student associations, on the model of that founded
      by Canisius at K&ouml;ln, were formed, and were affiliated to the Company
      of Jesus. Pilgrimages of students wended their way to famous shrines;
      talented young men submitted their souls to the direction of the Jesuit
      fathers, and shared in the hypnotic trance given by the course of the <i>Spiritual
      Exercises</i>. A generation of ardent souls was trained for the active
      service of the Roman Church, and vowed to combat Protestantism to the
      death.</p>
<p>The Company had another, not less important, field of work. The Peace
      of Augsburg had left the management of the religion of town or principality
      in the hands of the ruling secular authority. The maxim, <i>Cujus regio
      ejus religio</i>, placed the religious convictions of the population
      of many districts at the mercy of one man. Many Romanist Princes had
      no wish to persecute, still less to see their principalities depopulated
      by banishment. Some of them had given guarantees for freedom of conscience
      and limited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[Pg
      608]</a></span> rights of worship to their Protestant subjects. The
      Jesuits set themselves to change this condition of things. They could
      be charming confessors and still more delightful directors for the
      obedient sons and daughters of the Papacy. They were invited to take
      charge of the souls of many of the Princes and especially of the Princesses
      of Germany. They set themselves to charm, to command, and, lastly,
      to threaten their penitents. Toleration of Protestants they represented
      to be the unpardonable sin. They succeeded in many cases in inducing
      Romanist rulers to withdraw the protection they had hitherto accorded
      to their Protestant subjects, who, if they stood firm in their faith,
      had to leave their homes and seek refuge within a Protestant district.</p>
<p>Thus openly and stealthily the wave of Romanist reaction rolled northwards
      over Germany, and district after district was won back for the Papacy.
      This first period of the Counter-Reformation may be said to end with
      the sixteenth century; the second, which included the Thirty Years&rsquo;
      War, lies beyond our limit.</p>
<p>The savage struggle in France, culminating in the Massacre of St. Bartholomew,
      did not belong to the New Roman Catholicism, and lay outside of what
      may be called the Counter-Reformation proper. The force of this new
      aggressive movement was first felt in the formation of the Holy League,
      which had for its object to prevent Henry of Navarre from ascending
      the throne of France. The League was the symbol in France of this Counter-Reformation.
      The Jesuits never attained a preponderating influence in that country
      until the days of Marie de Medici; but they were the restless and ruthless
      organisers of the Holy League. The Jesuit fathers, Auger, Henri Saumier,
      and, above all, Claude Matthieu, called the <i>Courrier de la Ligue</i>,
      worked energetically on its behalf. The Company issued tracts from
      their printing-presses asserting the inalienable rights of the people
      to govern and therefore to choose their rulers. They taught that while
      God had given spiritual power into the hands of one man, the Pope,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[Pg
      609]</a></span> He had bestowed the secular power on the many. Kings,
      they asserted, do not reign by any divine right of hereditary succession,
      but by the will of the people and of the Pope. Hence all Romanist France
      was justified in setting aside the King of Navarre and putting in his
      place the Cardinal of Bourbon, his uncle.</p>
<p>The arguments they laid before the English people were based on principles
      altogether different, even contradictory. There they extolled hereditary
      and legitimate succession. Elizabeth was illegitimate, and Mary of
      Scotland had divine rights to the throne of England. It is needless
      to relate the efforts made by the leaders of the Counter-Reformation
      to bring England back to the Papacy&mdash;the College at Douai, the
      English College at Rome, both erected to train missionaries for service
      against the heretical Queen; the mission of the Jesuits, Parsons and
      Campion. The student of history can scarcely fail to note one thing,&mdash;that
      the sailing of the Spanish Armada marks the flood-tide of the first
      period of the Counter-Reformation. After the ruin of the great fleet
      the first wave of the reaction seems to have spent itself. The League
      failed in France, and Henry <span class="smcap">IV.</span> secured
      the rights of his Protestant subjects in the Edict of Nantes. The Hollanders
      emerged triumphant from their long war of liberation. Even in Germany
      the defeat of the Armada dates in a rough way the end of the impetus
      of the Romanist reaction. The German Protestants assumed the offensive
      again, and an energetic and aggressive Calvinism redeemed the halting
      character of the Lutheran Reformation.</p>
<p>Mr. Symonds, in his brilliant sketches of the forces at work to make the
      Romanist reaction, thinks that the part of the Jesuits in the Counter-Reformation
      has rather been exaggerated than insufficiently recognised. &ldquo;Without
      the ecclesiastical reform which originated in the Tridentine Council;
      without the gold and sword of Spain; without the stakes and prisons
      of the Inquisition; without the warfare against thought conducted by
      the Congregation of the Index,&mdash;the Jesuits alone could not have
      masterfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[Pg
      610]</a></span> governed the Catholic revival.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> This
      is perhaps true; but what would all these things have come to apart
      from the activity of the Company of Jesus? They were little better
      than the mechanism to which the enthusiasm and the indomitable work
      bred from enthusiasm gave the soul. Stern, relentless, savage repression
      can do much. It can make a desert and call it peace; but it cannot
      requicken with renewed life. The gentle piety of Carlo Borromeo, the
      sweet languishing tenderness of Francis de Sales, the revived medi&aelig;val
      mysticism discernible in the Romanist reaction, had neither the religious
      depth nor the endurance needed for the times. Ignatius breathed the
      Spanish spirit, at once wildly visionary and intensely practical, into
      his Company, and they transfused it throughout the Church of the Counter-Reformation&mdash;the
      exalted devotion, the tenacity which no reverses could wear out, and
      the unquenchable religious hope. They ruled it as the soul governs
      the body.</p>
<p>It was the time of Spanish domination. Spain grasped the New World and
      hoped to subdue the Old. Her soldiers were the best in Europe. They
      dreamed of nothing but conquests. The Jesuits brought the Spanish spirit
      into the Church. Others might scheme, and wish, and wonder. They worked.
      They reaped the harvest which hard and unremitting labour gathers in
      every field. It was not for nothing that Adrian and other papal statesmen
      dubbed Luther another Mahomet; the word kindled in every Spanish breast
      the memory of their centuries of war with the Moslems and its victorious
      ending. If the gold and sword of Spain were at the service of the Counter-Reformation,
      it was the Spanish spirit incarnate in the Company of Jesus that made
      such dry bones live.</p>
<p>We must remember that in the first period of the Romanist reaction we
      have to do with the Jesuits of the sixteenth century, and must banish
      from our minds the history of the Order in the two centuries that follow.
      Its worst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[Pg
      611]</a></span> side had scarcely appeared. Its theory of Probabilism,
      by which directors were trained to transform all deadly sins, even
      murder, adultery, and theft, into venial offences, and casuistry became
      a method for the entire guidance of souls, belonged to a later period.
      It was not till the seventeenth century that the forgiveness of sins
      had been reduced by them to a highly refined art. Their shameless neglect
      of religion and morality, when the political interests of the Church
      and of the Society seemed to require it, was also later. What the depressed
      Romanists of the sixteenth century saw was a body of men whom no difficulties
      daunted, who spent themselves in training boys and girls and in animating
      them with religious principles; who persuaded boys and youths to attend
      daily Mass, to resort to monthly confession, to study the articles
      of their faith; who elevated that obedience, which for generations
      they had been taught was due to the earthly head of the Church, into
      a sublime religious principle.</p>
<p>All this the Romanism of the Counter-Reformation owed to those three unknown
      men, who crept into Rome through the Porto del Popolo during Easter
      1538 to beg Pope Paul <span class="smcap">III.</span> to permit them
      and their companions to enroll themselves in a new Order, for the defence
      of the faith.</p>
<p>It is true that men can never get rid of their personal responsibility
      in spiritual things, but multitudes will always attempt to cast the
      burden upon others. In all such souls the spirit of the Counter-Reformation
      lives and moves and has its being, and they are sustained, consciously
      or unconsciously, by that principle of blind obedience which its preachers
      taught. It is enough for us to remember that no weakened sense of personal
      responsibility and no amount of superstitious practice can utterly
      quench the conscience that seeks its God, or can hinder that upward
      glance to the Father in heaven which carries with it a living faith.</p>

            in a Bull (Feb. 15, 1559) that the mere fact of heresy in princes
            deprived them of all lawful power; but he named no one. When
            his successor proposed, in 1563, to excommunicate Elizabeth of
            England by name simply as a Protestant, he was taken to task
            sharply by the Emperor Ferdinand; and the Queen was finally excommunicated
            in 1570 as a partaker &ldquo;in the atrocious mysteries of Calvinism,&rdquo; and

            fullest account of these German Reformed confessions is to be
            found in M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s <i>Die Bekenntnisschriften der reformirten
            Kirche</i>&mdash;the <i>Emden Catechism</i> (1554), pp. 1 and
            666; the <i>Heidelberg Catechism</i> (1563), pp. 1, 682; the <i>Nassau

            Consensus</i> (1595), liv, 739; the <i>Staffort Book</i> (1559)
            for Baden, liv, 797; the <i>Confession of the General Synod of
            Cassel</i>, lv and 817, and the <i>Hessian Catechism</i> (1607),
            822; and the <i>Bentheim Confession</i> (1613), 833. All these
            German Reformed confessions followed Melanchthon in his endeavours
            to unite the Calvinist and the Lutheran doctrinal positions.</p>
      <p> By far the most celebrated, and the only one which maintains its
            place as a doctrinal symbol down to the present day, is the <i>Heidelberg
            Catechism</i>. It was drafted at the suggestion of the Elector
            Frederick the Pious by two theologians, Caspar Olevianus and
            Zacharias Ursinus, who were able to express in a really remarkable
            degree the thoughts of German Protestants who could not accept
            the hard and fast Lutheranism of the opponents of Melanchthon.
            It speedily found favour in many parts of Germany, although its
            strongest supporters belonged to the Rhine provinces. It was
            in use both as a means of instruction and as a doctrinal symbol
            in most of the German Reformed Churches along with their own
            symbolical books. Its use spread to Holland and beyond it. Two
            separate translations appeared in Scotland. The earlier is contained
            in (Dunlop&rsquo;s) <i>Collection of Confessions of Faith.... of public
            authority in the Church of Scotland</i>, under the title, <i>A
            Catechism of the Christian Religion, composed by Zachary Ursinus,
            approved by Frederick <span class="smcap">III.</span> Elector
            Palatine, the Reformed Church in the Palatinate, and by other
            Reformed Churches in Germany; and taught in their schools and
            churches: examined and approved, without any alteration, by the
            Synod of Dort, and appointed to be taught in the reformed churches
            and schools in the Netherlands: translated and printed Anno 1591
            by public authority for the use of Scotland, with the arguments
            and use of the several doctrines therein contained, by Jeremias
            Bastingius; sometimes printed with the Book of Common Order and

            Farel was born in 1489 at a village near Gap in the mountainous
            south-east corner of Dauphin&eacute;, on the border of Provence.
            He belonged to a noble family, and was devout from his earliest
            years. He describes a pilgrimage which he made as a child in
            his book <i>Du vray usage de la croix de J&eacute;sus-Christ</i> (pp.
            223 <i>f.</i>). All through his adventurous life he preserved
            his rare uprightness of character, his fervent devotion, and
            his indignation at wrong-doing of all kinds. He persuaded his
            parents to allow him to go to Paris for education, and reached
            the capital about 1509. He probably spent twelve years there,
            partly as student and partly as professor in the college Le Moine.
            There he became the friend and devoted disciple of Jacques Lef&egrave;vre
            d&rsquo;&Eacute;taples, and this friendship carried him safely through
            several religious crises in his life. He followed Lef&egrave;vre
            to Meaux, and was one of the celebrated &ldquo;group&rdquo; there. When persecution
            and the timidity or scruples of the bishop caused the dispersion
            of these preachers, Farel went back to Dauphin&eacute; and attempted
            to preach the Gospel in Gap. He was not allowed <i>parce qu&rsquo;il
            n&rsquo;estoit ne moine ne prestre</i>, and was banished from the district
            by bishop and people. He next tried to preach in Guyenne, where
            he was equally unsuccessful. Thinking that there was no place
            in France open to him, he took himself to Basel. There he asked
            the University to allow him to hold a public disputation on certain
            articles which he sent to them. The authorities refused. He then
            addressed himself to the Council of the city, who permitted the
            discussion. The thirteen articles or <i>Theses</i> defended by
            Farel are given in Herminjard, <i>Correspondance des R&eacute;formateurs
            dans les pays de langue fran&ccedil;aise</i> (i. 194, 195). He
            gathered a little church of French refugees at Basel (the <i>ecclesiola</i> of
            his correspondence), but was too much the ardent and impetuous
            pioneer to remain quietly among them. By the end of July 1524
            he was preaching at Montb&egrave;liard, some miles to the south
            of Belfort, and the riots which ensued caused Oecolampadius to
            beseech him to temper his courage with discretion (Herminjard, <i>Correspondance</i>,
            etc., i. 255). He went thence to Strassburg (April 1525), to
            Bern, attempted to preach in Neuch&acirc;tel, and finally (middle
            of November 1526) opened a school at Aigle, an outlying dependency
            of Bern, hoping to get opportunity to carry on his evangelistic
            work. He was soon discovered, and attempts were made to prevent
            his preaching; but the authorities of Bern insisted that he should
            be unmolested. In the beginning of 1527 he was actively engaged
            at the great Disputation in Bern. That same year he was made
            pastor of Aigle and put in possession of the parsonage and the
            stipend; but such work was too tame for him. He made long preaching
            tours; we find him at Lausanne, Morat, Orbe, and other places,
            always protected by the authorities of Bern. He began his work
            in Geneva in 1532.</p>

            of Theology of the University of K&ouml;ln; taught for some time

            and his great eloquence made him a power in the city; but his
            discouragements were so many and so great that he was often on
            the point of leaving. Zwingli encouraged him to remain and persevere.</p>

            de Watteville, born in 1492, was canon of St. Vincent in Bern,
            protonotary apostolic, prior of Montpreveyres, and provost of
            Lausanne. He visited Rome in 1517, and there received the Abbey
            of Montheron; and the year following he was made a papal chamberlain
            to Pope Leo x. He gave up all his benefices on December 1st,
            and soon afterwards married Clara May, a nun who had left the
            convent of K&ouml;nigsfeld. He was always a great admirer of
            William Farel, and often interfered to protect the impetuous
            Reformer from the consequences of his own rashness. His younger
            brother, J. J. de Watteville, became Advoyer or President of
            Bern, and was a notable figure in the history of the Reformation
            in Switzerland. The family of de Watteville is still represented
            among the citizens of Bern.</p>

            early as June 15th, 1523, the Council of Bern had issued an ordinance
            for the preachers throughout their territories, which enjoined
            them to preach publicly and without dissimulation the Holy Gospel
            and the doctrine of God, and to say nothing which they could
            not establish by true and Holy Scripture; to leave entirely alone
            all other doctrines and discussions contrary to the Gospel, and
            in particular the distinctive doctrines of Luther. Later (May
            21st, 1526), at a conference held between members of the Council
            of Bern, deputies from the Bernese communes, and delegates from
            the seven Roman Catholic cantons, it was agreed to permit no
            innovation in matters of religion. This agreement was not maintained
            long; and the Bernese went back to their ordinance of June 1523.
            It seems to have been practically interpreted to mean that preachers
            might attack the power of the Pope, and the doctrines of Purgatory
            and the Invocation of Saints, but that they were not to say anything
            against the current doctrine of the sacraments. Cf. Decrees of
            the Council of Bern, quoted in Herminjard, <i>Correspondance
            des R&eacute;formateurs dans les pays de langue fran&ccedil;aise</i>,
            (Geneva, 1878), i. 434 <i>n.</i>, ii. 23 <i>n.</i>, also 20.</p>

            read of Luther&rsquo;s books being read in Geneva as early as May 1521,
            and that their effect was to give several of the people heart
            to care little for the threats of the Pope; in 1522, Cornelius
            Agrippa, writing to Capito (June 17th), and Haller, writing to
            Zwingli (July 8th), speak of Francis Lambert (<i>vir probus et
            diligens minister Verbi Dei</i>), who had preached in Geneva,
            Lausanne, Freiburg, and Bern; and in 1527, Hofen, secretary to
            the Council of Bern, writing to Zwingli (Jan. 15th), thinks that
            Geneva could be won for the Reformation,&mdash;he had noticed
            that the people no longer cared much for Indulgences or for the
            Mass (Herminjard, <i>Correspondance</i>, etc. i. 101-3, 318 <i>n.</i>,

            large mansion occupied by the Seigneur de Thorens, a strong partisan
            of the Reformation. He was a Savoyard, expelled from his country
            because of his religious principles. He acquired citizenship
            in Bern. The Bernese, on the eve of their embassy, which reached
            Geneva on Jan. 4th, had bought this house, and placed M. de Thorens
            therein, intending it to be a place where the Evangelicals could
            meet in safety under the protection of Bern. It is probable that
            in time of special danger the Evangelicals met there for public
            worship. When the Council of Freiburg objected to Farel&rsquo;s preaching,
            the Council of Geneva replied that the services were held in

            poison was placed in some spinach soup, and the popular story
            was that Farel escaped because he did not like the food; that
            Froment had seated himself at table to take his share, when news
            was brought to him that his wife and children had arrived at
            Geneva&mdash;he rose from the table at once to go to meet them,
            and left the soup untasted. Poor Viret was the only one who took
            his share, and became very ill immediately afterwards. The prisoner&rsquo;s
            confession, lately exhumed from the Geneva archives, tells another
            tale. The woman said that she stuffed a small bone with the poison,
            and placed it in Viret&rsquo;s bowl; but was afraid to do the same
            to Farel&rsquo;s because his soup was too clear. Cf. extracts quoted

            every Latin class. He became a convert of the Reformed faith,
            and did his best to spread Evangelical doctrines by means of
            the sentences to be turned into Latin. He followed his great
            pupil to Geneva, and died there in his eighty-eighth year.</p>

            action of the people of the four parishes which made the district
            of Thyez illustrates a condition of mind not easily sympathised
            with by us, and it shows what the commonalty of the sixteenth
            century thought of the powers of the Councils which ruled their
            city republics. The district belonged to Geneva, and was under
            the rule of the Council of that city. The inhabitants had been
            permitted to retain the Romanist religion. They were, nevertheless,
            excommunicated by their Bishop for clinging to Geneva with loyalty.
            They were honest Roman Catholics; they could not bear the thought
            of living under excommunication, and longed for absolution; the
            Bishop would not grant it; so the <i>people applied to the Council
            of Geneva to absolve them</i>, which the Council did by a minute
            which runs as follows:
            &ldquo;(April 4th, 1535) Sur ce qu&rsquo;est propos&eacute; par nostre chastelain
            de Thyez, que ceux de Thyez font doubte soy pr&eacute;senter
            en l&rsquo;esglise &agrave; ces Pasques prochaines (April 16th), &agrave; cause
            d&rsquo;aucunes lettres d&rsquo;excommuniement qui sont est&eacute;
            contre aucuns ex&eacute;cut&eacute;es, par quoi volentier ils
            desirent avoir rem&egrave;de de absolution.... Est est&eacute; r&eacute;solu

            a centre for the Humanists and Reformers of France; when she

            Venetian Ambassador at the Court of France, writing in 1561 to

            and the great power which the principal minister of Geneva, by
            name Calvin, a Frenchman and a native of Picardy, possesses in
            this kingdom. He is a man of extraordinary authority, who by
            his mode of life, his doctrines and his writings, rises superior
            to all the rest&rdquo; (<i>Calendar of State Papers, Venetian, 1558-80</i>,

            did not lack imagination. The sanctified imagination has never
            made grander or loftier flight than in the thought of the <i>Purpose

            and for the establishment of the Kingdom, which is the master-idea
            in the <i>Christian Institution</i>. It was de B&egrave;ze (Beza),
            not Calvin, who was the father of the seventeenth century doctrine
            of predestination,&mdash;a conception which differed from Calvin&rsquo;s

            The <i>Parlements</i> are frequently mentioned under the names
            of the towns in which they met; thus the <i>Parlement</i> of

                  has been found to be almost invariably correct, and without

            singing of Clement Marot&rsquo;s version of the Psalms was not distinctively
            Protestant. The first edition of the translation, including thirty
            Psalms, appeared in Paris in 1541 and in Geneva in 1542. The
            Geneva edition had an appendix, entitled <i>La mani&eacute;re
            d&rsquo;administrer les sacrements selon la coutume de l&rsquo;&Eacute;glise
            ancienne et comme on l&rsquo;observe &agrave; Gen&egrave;ve</i>, and
            was undoubtedly a Protestant book; but the Paris edition contained
            instead rhymed versions of the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, of the Apostles&rsquo;
            Creed, and of the angel&rsquo;s salutation to the Virgin. The book
            was a great favourite with Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span>,
            who is said to have sung some of the Psalms on his deathbed.
            It was very popular at the Court of Henri <span class="smcap">II.</span>,
            where it became fashionable for the courtiers to select a favourite
            Psalm, which the King permitted them to call &ldquo;their own.&rdquo; Henri&rsquo;s &ldquo;own&rdquo; was
            Ps. xlii., <i>Comme un cerf alt&eacute;r&eacute;
            bramc apr&egrave;s l&rsquo;eau courante</i>. He was a great huntsman.
            Catherine de Medici&rsquo;s was Ps. vi. The Psalm-singing at the Pr&eacute;-aux-Clercs,
            however, was regarded as a manifestation against the Court, and
            d&rsquo;Andelot was imprisoned for his persistent attendance.</p>

            family of Guise, who played such a leading part in French history
            from the reign of Henry <span class="smcap">II.</span> on to
            the downfall of the League, became French in the person of Claude,
            the fifth son of Ren&eacute;, Duke of Lorraine, who inherited
            the lands of his father which were situated in France. Francis <span class="smcap">I.</span> had
            loaded him with honours and lands. The family had always been
            devoted to the Papacy, and had profited by their devotion. The
            brother of Claude, Jean, had been made a Cardinal when he was
            twenty, and had accumulated in his own person an immense number
            of benefices. These descended to his nephews, Charles, who was
            first Cardinal of Guise and then Cardinal of Lorraine, and Louis,
            who was Cardinal of Guise. The accumulated benefices enjoyed
            by Charles amounted to over 300,000 livres. The Guises did not
            serve the Roman Church for nothing.</p>

            because it was supposed to be largely inhabited by Protestants.
            It was selected because of its remoteness from the centre of

                  to hinder it for the future: they prepared two little irons,
                  between which the tongue was screwed, which being seared
                  at the tip with a glowing iron, would swell to such a degree

            of France on the river Rhone, its south-west corner being about
            ten miles north of the city of Avignon. Henry of Nassau, the
            uncle of our William of Orange, had married Claude, the sister
            of Philibert, the last male of the House of Orange-Chalons; and
            Philibert had bequeathed his principality to his nephew Ren&eacute;,
            the son of Henry and Claude. The principality was of no great
            value compared with the other possessions of the House of Nassau,
            but as it was under no overlord, its possessor took rank among
            the <i>sovereign</i> princes of Europe.</p>

            succeeded his father as Stadtholder, and became Prince of Orange
            in 1618 on the death of his elder brother, Philip William, who
            was kidnapped from Louvain and brought up as a Roman Catholic
            by Philip <span class="smcap">II.</span> William was married
            four times:</p>
      <p> <i>a.</i> In 1550, to Anne of Egmont, only child of Maximilian
            of Buren. Her son was Philip William; she died in March 1558.</p>
      <p> <i>b.</i> In 1561, to Anne, daughter of the Elector Maurice of
            Saxony, and granddaughter of Philip of Hesse. She early developed
            symptoms of incipient insanity, which came to a height when she
            deserted her husband in 1567 and went to live a disreputable
            life in Cologne. She became insane, and her family seized her
            and imprisoned her until she died in 1573. She was the mother
            of Maurice.</p>
      <p> <i>c.</i> In 1571, Charlotte de Bourbon, daughter of the Due de
            Montpensier. She had been a nun, had embraced the Reformed faith,
            and fled to Germany. The marriage was a singularly happy one.
            She was scarcely recovered from childbirth when William was almost
            killed by Jaureguy, and the shock, combined with her incessant
            toil in nursing her husband, was too much for her strength; she
            died in 1582 (May 5th).</p>
      <p> <i>d.</i> In 1583, to Louise de Coligny, daughter of the celebrated
            Admiral Coligny. She had lost both her parents in the Massacre
            of Saint Bartholomew. She was a wonderful and charming woman,
            beloved by her stepchildren and adored by her adopted country;
            she survived her husband forty years.</p>

                  in which there is the following (p. 155):
            &ldquo;Touching images set in the churches, as books of the unlearned,
            though they are not necessary, but rather give occasion to Jews,
            Turks, and Saracens to think we are idolaters, the King tolerates
            them, except those about which idolatry has been committed....
            Our Lady of Worcester, when her garments were taken off, was
            found to be the similitude of a bishop, like a giant, almost
            ten feet long;... the roods at Boxelegh and other places, which
            moved their eyes and lips when certain keys and strings were
            bent or pulled in secret places&mdash;images of this sort the
            King has caused to be voided and committed other as it was convenient,
            following the example of King Hezekiah, who destroyed the brazen
            serpent. Shrines, copses, and reliquaries, so called, have been
            found to be feigned things, as the blood of Christ was but a
            piece of red silk enclosed in a thick glass of crystalline, and
            in another place oil coloured of <i>sanguis draconis</i>, instead
            of the milk of Our Lady a piece of chalk or ceruse. Our Lady&rsquo;s
            girdle, the verges of Moses and Aaron, etc., and more of the
            Holy Cross than three cars may carry, the King has therefore
            caused to be taken away and the abusive pieces burnt, and the
            doubtful sort hidden away honestly for fear of idolatry.&rdquo;</p>

            Pollard (<i>Cambridge Modern History</i>, ii. pp. 478, 479) thinks
            that the influence of these foreign divines on the English Reformation
            has been overrated; and he is probably correct so far as changes
            in worship and usages go. His idea is that the English Reformers
            followed the lead of Wiclif, consciously or unconsciously, rather
            than that of continental divines; but if the root-thought in
            all Reformation theology be considered, it may be doubted whether
            Wiclif <i>could</i> supply what the English divines had in common
            with their continental contemporaries. &ldquo;Wiclif, with all his
            desire for Reformation, was essentially a medi&aelig;val thinker.&rdquo; The
            theological question which separated every medi&aelig;val Reformer
            from the thinkers of the Reformation was, How the benefits won
            by the atoning work of Christ were to be appropriated by men?
            The universal medi&aelig;val answer was, By an imitation of Christ;
            while the universal Reformation answer was, By trust in the promises
            of God (for that is what is meant by Justification by Faith).
            In their answer to this test question, the English divines are
            at one with the Reformers on the Continent, and not with Wiclif.</p>

            Dixon (<i>History of the Church of England</i>, v. 67) declares
            that the phrase &ldquo;Supreme Head&rdquo; was not in the Bill. He has overlooked
            the fact that Heath in his speech against it quotes the actual
            words used in the proposed Act: &ldquo;I promised to move your honours
            to consider what this supremacy is which we go about by virtue
            of this Act to give to the Queen&rsquo;s Highness, and wherein it doth
            consist, as whether in spiritual government or in temporal. If
            in spiritual, like as the words of the Act do import, scilicet: <i>Supreme
            Head of the Church of England immediate and next under God</i>,
            then it would be considered whether this House hathe authority

            Easter Day, Her Majesty appeared in the chapel, where Mass was
            sung in English, according to the use of her brother, King Edward,
            and the communion was received in both &lsquo;kinds,&rsquo; kneeling, <i>facendoli
            il sacerdote la credenza del corpo et sangue prima</i>; nor did
            he wear anything but the mere surplice (<i>la semplice cotta</i>),
            having divested himself of the vestments (<i>li paramenti</i>)
            in which he had sung Mass; and thus Her Majesty was followed
            by many Lords both of the Council and others. Since that day
            things have returned to their former state, though unless the
            Almighty stretch forth His arm a relapse is expected. These accursed
            preachers, who have come from Germany, do not fail to preach
            in their own fashion, both in public and in private, in such
            wise that they persuaded certain rogues to forcibly enter the
            church of St. Mary-le-Bow, in the middle of Cheapside, and force
            the shrine of the most Holy Sacrament, breaking the tabernacle,
            and throwing the most precious consecrated body of Jesus Christ
            to the ground. They also destroyed the altar and the images,
            with the pall (<i>palio</i>) and church linen (<i>tovalie</i>),
            breaking everything into a thousand pieces. This happened this
            very night, which is the third after Easter.... Many persons

            published a proclamation to banish the Pope and his jurisdiction

      <p> Dr. Gee seems to beg an important historical question when he says

            knew that the Prayer-Book had been actually altered in more than
            the three points mentioned in the Act of Uniformity. Grindal,
            writing again to Hubert on July 14th, when he must have known
            everything, says: &ldquo;The state of our Church (to come to that subject)
            is pretty much the same as when I last wrote to you, except only
            that what had heretofore been settled by proclamations and laws
            with respect to the reformation of the churches is now daily

            1559, was: &ldquo;And here is to be noted that the minister at the
            time of communion, and at all other times in his ministration,
            shall use <i>neither alb, vestment, nor cope; but being archbishop
            or bishop, he shall have and wear a rochet: and being priest
            or deacon, he shall have and wear a surplice only.</i>&rdquo;</p>
      <p> This is the real <i>ornaments</i> rubric of the Elizabethan settlement,
            and appears to be such in the use and wont of the Church of England
            from 1559 to 1566, save that <i>copes</i> were used occasionally.</p>
      <p> The proviso in the Act of Uniformity (1559) was: &ldquo;Such ornaments
            of the Church and of the ministers thereof shall be retained
            and be in use as was in this Church of England by authority of
            Parliament in the <i>second</i> year of the reign of King Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span>,
            until other order shall be therein taken by the authority of
            the Queen&rsquo;s Majesty, with the advice of her commissioners appointed
            and authorised under the Great Seal of England for causes ecclesiastical,
            or of the metropolitan of this realm.&rdquo;</p>
      <p> The ornaments in use in the second year of Edward <span class="smcap">VI.</span> are
            stated in the rubrics of the first Prayer-Book of King Edward
            (1549):</p>
      <p> &ldquo;Upon the day, and at the time appointed for the ministration of
            the Holy Communion, the Priest that shall execute the holy ministry
            shall put upon him the vesture appointed for that ministration,
            that is to say: a white Albe plain, with a vestment or Cope.
            And where there be many Priests or Deacons, there so many shall
            be ready to help the Priest in the ministration as shall be requisite:
            and shall have upon them likewise the vestures appointed for
            their ministry, that is to say, Albes with tunicles.&rdquo; At the
            end there is another rubric: &ldquo;Upon Wednesdays and Fridays, the
            English Litany shall be said or sung in all places after such
            form as is appointed by the King&rsquo;s Majesty&rsquo;s Injunctions; or
            as is or shall be otherwise appointed by His Highness. And though
            there be none to communicate with the Priest, yet these days
            (after the Litany ended) the Priest shall put upon him a plain
            Albe or surplice, with a cope, and say all things at the Altar
            appointed to be said at the celebration of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper,
            until after the offertory.&rdquo;</p>

            rubric is: &ldquo;And here it is to be noted that the minister at the

            shall use such ornaments in the church as were in use by authority

            according to the Act of Parliament set in the beginning of this
            Book.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="footnote">
      <p><a name="Footnote_569_569" id="Footnote_569_569"></a><a href="#FNanchor_569_569"><span class="label">[569]</span></a> Dr.
            Gee (<i>Elizabethan Ornaments</i>, etc. p. 131) thinks that there
            can be no reasonable doubt that the rubric was recorded on the
            authority of the Privy Council. &ldquo;The Privy Council had certainly
            inserted the Black Rubric in 1552, as their published Acts attest,
            but all the records of the Privy Council from 13th May 1559 until
            28th May 1562 have disappeared.&rdquo;
            The precedent cited is scarcely a parallel case. The Black Rubric
            was an explanation; the Rubric of 1559 is almost a contradiction
            in terms of the Act which restores the Prayer-Book of 1552. If
            I may venture to express an opinion, it seems to me most likely
            that the rubric was added by the Queen herself, and that she
            inserted it in order to be able to &ldquo;hedge.&rdquo; It is too often forgotten
            that the danger which overshadowed the earlier years of Elizabeth
            was the issue of a papal Bull proclaiming her a heretic and a
            bastard, and inviting Henry <span class="smcap">II.</span> of
            France to undertake its execution. The Emperor would never permit
            such a Bull if Elizabeth could show reasonable pretext that she
            and her kingdom held by the Lutheran type of Protestantism. An
            excommunication pronounced in such a case would have invalidated
            his own position, which he owed to the votes of Lutheran Electors.
            In the middle of the sixteenth century the difference between
            the different sections of Christianity was always estimated in
            the <i>popular</i> mind by differences in public worship, and
            especially in the celebration of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper. All over
            Germany the Protestant was distinguished from the Romanist by
            the fact that he partook of the communion in both &ldquo;kinds.&rdquo; Elizabeth
            had definitely ranged herself on the Protestant side from Easter
            Day 1559; and a more or less ornate ritual could never explain
            away the significance of this fact. The great difference between
            the Lutherans and the Calvinists to the popular mind was that
            the former retained and the latter discarded most of the old
            ceremonial. Luther says expressly: &ldquo;Da lassen wyr die Messgewand,
            altar, liechter noch bleyben&rdquo; (Daniel, <i>Codex Liturgicus Ecclesi&aelig;,
            Lutheran&aelig;</i>, p. 105); and crosses, vestments, lights,
            and an altar appear in regular Lutheran fashion whenever the
            Queen wished to place herself and her land under the shield of
            the Augsburg Peace. This rubric was a remarkably good card to
            play in the diplomatic game.</p>

            used in the cathedrals and sometimes in collegiate churches in
            the years between 1559 and 1566, when it was desired to add some
            magnificence to the service; but it ought to be remembered that
            the <i>cope</i> was never a sacrificial vestment. It was originally
            the <i>cappa</i> of the earlier Middle Ages&mdash;the medi&aelig;val
            greatcoat. Large churches were cold places, the clergy naturally
            wore their greatcoats when officiating, and the homely garment
            grew in magnificence. It never had a doctrinal significance like
            the <i>chasuble</i> or <i>casula</i>.</p>

            was born in 1511, in the small town of Tudela, which then belonged
            to Aragon. He came from an ancient family of jurists, and was
            at first destined to the profession of law. His family came originally
            from the township of Villanova, which probably accounts for the
            fact that Servede sometimes assumed that name. He was in correspondence
            with Oecolampadius (Heusgen) in 1530; and from the former&rsquo;s letters
            to and about Servede, it is evident that the young Spaniard was
            then fully persuaded about his anti-Trinitarian opinions. No
            publisher in Basel would print his book, and he travelled to
            Strassburg. When his first theological book became known, its
            sale was generally interdicted by the secular authorities. His
            great book, which contains his whole theological thinking, was
            published in 1553 without name of place or author. Its full title
            is: <i>Christianismi Restitutio, Totius ecclesi&aelig; apostolic&aelig; ad
            sua limina vocatio, in integrum restituta cognitione Dei, fidei
            Christi, justificationis nostr&aelig;, regenerationis baptisimi
            et c&#339;n&aelig; domini manducationis, Restituto denique nobis
            regno c&#339;lesti, Babylonis impi&aelig; captivitate soluta,
            et Antichristo cum suis penitus destructo.</i> He entered into
            correspondence with Calvin, offered to come to Geneva to explain
            his position; but the Reformer plainly indicated that he had
            no time to bestow upon him. The account of his trial, condemnation,
            and burning at Geneva is to be found in the <i>Corpus Reformatorum</i>,
            xxxvi. 720 <i>ff.</i> The sentence is found on p. 825: &ldquo;Icy est
            este parle du proces de Michiel Servet prisonnier et veu le sommairre
            dycelluy, le raport de ceux esquelz lon a consulte et considere
            les grands erreurs et blaffemes&mdash;est este arreste Il soit
            condampne a estre mene en Champel et la estre brusle tout vyfz
            et soit exequente a demain et ses livres brusles.&rdquo; This trial
            and execution is the one black blot on the character of Calvin.
            He was by no means omnipotent in Geneva at the time; but he thoroughly
            approved of what was done, and had expressed the opinion that
            if Servede came to Geneva, he would not leave it alive. &ldquo;Nam
            si venerit modo valeat mea auctoritas, virum exire nunquam patiar&rdquo; (<i>Corpus
            Ref.</i> xi. 283).</p>

            who justifies the treatment his hero meted out to the Anabaptists&mdash;roasting

            disease was known as the English plague or the sweating sickness.
            It is thus described by Hecker (<i>Epidemics of the Middle Ages</i>,
            p. 181):
            &ldquo;It was violent inflammatory fever, which, after a short rigour,
            prostrated the powers as with a blow; and amidst painful oppression
            at the stomach, headache, and lethargic stupor, suffused the
            whole body with f&#339;tid perspiration. All this took place
            within the course of a few hours, and the crisis was always over
            within the space of a day and a night. The internal heat that
            the patient suffered was intolerable, yet every refrigerant was
            death.&rdquo;</p>

            was born at Stadtlohn, and received the rudiments of education
            in the village school there; a relation sent him to the Gymnasium
            at M&uuml;nster; he studied afterwards at Mainz, where he received

            Bockelson, commonly called Jan van Leyden, was the illegitimate
            son of a village magistrate, and was born near Leyden in 1510.
            After a brief time of education at a village school he was apprenticed
            to a tailor, and in his leisure hours diligently educated himself.
            He travelled more widely than artisans usually did during their
            year of wandering&mdash;visiting England as well as most parts
            of Flanders. On his return home he married the widow of a shipmaster,
            and started business as a merchant. He was a prominent member
            of the literary &ldquo;gilds&rdquo; of his town, and had a local fame as
            a poet and an actor. His conversion through Jan Matthys changed
            his whole life; there is not the slightest reason to suppose
            that he was not an earnest and honest adherent of the Anabaptist
            doctrines as taught by Matthys. He is described as strikingly
            handsome, with a fine sonorous voice. He had remarkable powers
            of organisation. His whole brief life reveals him to be a very
            remarkable man. He was barely twenty-five when he was tortured
            to death by the Bishop of M&uuml;nster after the capture of the
            town.</p>

            who was present at the conference, sums up the results so far
            in a letter to Farel as follows: <i>Delecti nostri de peccato
            originali non difficulter transegerunt: sequuta est disputatio
            de libero arbitrio, qu&aelig; ex Augustini sententia composita
            fuit: nihil in utroque nobis decessit. De justifcatione acriores
            fuerunt contentiones. Tandem conscripta est formula, quam adhibitis
            certis correctionibus utrinque receperunt. Miraberis, scio, adversarios
            tantum concessisse, quum legeris exemplar, ita ut postrema manu
            correctum fuit, quod literis inclusum reperies. Retinuerunt enim
            nostri doctrin&aelig; ver&aelig; summam: ut nihil illic comprehensum
            sit, quod non exstet in scriptis nostris: scio, desiderabis clariorem
            explicationem, et in ca re me tibi assentientem habebis. Verum,
            si reputes quibuscum hominibus negotium nobis sit, agnosces multum
            esse effectum</i> (<i>Corpus Reformatorum</i>, xxxix. 215). Calvin
            had been somewhat suspicious of Contarini at the outset: <i>Contarenus
            sine sanguine subigere nos cupit; proiude tentat omnes vias confieiendi
            ex sua utilitate negotii citra arma</i> (<i>ibid.</i> xxxix.

            proceedings of the conference are given in full in the <i>Acta
            Ratisbonensia</i>. By far the most succinct account is to be
            found in Calvin&rsquo;s letter to Farel of date 11th May 1541. He says
            of the discussion about the sacraments: <i>In sacramentis rixati
            sunt nonnihil: sed quum nostri suas illis c&aelig;remonias, ut
            res medias, permitterent, usque ad c&aelig;nam progressi sunt.
            Illic fuit insuperabilis scopulus. Repudiata transubstantiatio,
            repositio, circumgestatio, et reliqui superstitiosi cultus. H&aelig;c
            adversariis nequaquam tolerabilia. Collega meus (Bucer), qui
            totus ardet studio concordi&aelig;, fremere et indignari, quod
            intempestive fuissent mot&aelig; eiusmodi qu&aelig;stiones, Philippus
            (Melanchthon) in adversam partem magis tendere, ut rebus exulceratis
            omnem pacificationis spem pr&aelig;cideret. Nostri habita consultatione,
            nos convocarunt. Jussi sumus omnes ordine dicere sententias:
            fuit una omnium vox, transubstantiationem rem esse fictitiam,
            repositionem superstitiosam, idololatricam esse adorationem,
            vel saltem periculosam, quum fiat sine verbo Dei. Me quoque exponere
            latine oportuit quid sentirem. Tametsi neminem ex aliis intellexeram</i> (because
            they spoke in German), <i>libere tamen sine timore offensionis,
            illam localem pr&aelig;sentiam damnari: adorationem asserui mihi
            esse intolerabilem. Crede mihi, in eiusmodi actionibus opus est
            fortibus animis, qui alios confirment.... Scriptum deinde a Philippo
            compositum, quod ubi Granvellano oblatum est, asperis verbis
            repudiavit, quod illi tres delecti ad nos retulissent. H&aelig;c
            quum fiant in ipso limine, cogita quantum adhuc supersit difficultatis,
            in missa privata, sacrificio, in communicatione calicis. Quid

            residence of Ignatius Loyola in the College of Ste. Barbe is
            connected with au incident which is at once illustrative of his
            own spirit and of the manners of the time. He had come to Paris
            for the purpose of study; but he could not resist the temptation
            to make converts to his great mission. Among these converts was
            a Spaniard named Amador, a promising student in philosophy in
            Ste. Barbe. This Amador, Loyola had transformed from a diligent
            student into a visionary as wild as himself, to the intense indignation
            of the University, and especially of his own countrymen. About
            the same time Loyola craved permission to attend Ste. Barbe as
            a student of philosophy. He was admitted on the express condition
            that he should make no attempt on the consciences of his fellows.
            Loyola kept his word as far as Amador was concerned, but he could
            not resist the temptation to communicate his visions to others.
            The Regent thrice warned him of what would be the result, and
            at length made his complaint to the Principal (Jacques de Gouv&eacute;a).
            Gouv&eacute;a was furious, and gave orders that next day Loyola
            should be subjected to the most disgraceful punishment the College
            could inflict. This running of the gauntlet, known as <i>la salle</i>,
            was administered in the following manner. After dinner, when
            all the scholars were present, the masters, each with his ferule
            in his hand, ranged themselves in a double row. The delinquent,
            stripped to the waist, was then made to pass between them, receiving
            a blow across the shoulders from each. This was the ignominious
            punishment to which Loyola, then in his fortieth year, as a member
            of the College, was bound to submit. The tidings of what was
            in store for him reached his ears, and in a private interview
            he contrived to turn away Gouv&eacute;a&rsquo;s wrath.... This was
            in 1529, the year of Buchanan&rsquo;s entrance into Ste, Barbe&rdquo; (P.
            Hume Brown, <i>George Buchanan, Humanist and Reformer</i>, Edinburgh,
            1890, pp. 62 <i>f.</i>).</p>

            careful study of the <i>Exercises</i>, of the <i>Directory</i>,
            of Loyola&rsquo;s correspondence, and of his sayings recorded by early
            and contemporary biographers, has convinced me that the book
            was mainly constructed out of the abundant notes which Loyola
            took of his own inward experiences at Manresa, and that the only
            book he used in compiling it was the <i>De Imitatione Christi</i> of
            Thomas &agrave; Kempis&mdash;a book which Ignatius believed to
            have been written by Gerson. We know otherwise how highly Ignatius
            prized the <i>De Imitatione</i>. When he visited the Abbey of
            Monte Cassino he took with him as many copies as there were monks
            in the monastery; it was the one volume which he kept on the
            small table at his bedside; and it was the only book which the
            neophyte was permitted to read during the first week of the <i>Exercises</i>: &ldquo;si
            tamen instructori videbitur, posset in prima hebdomada legere
            librum Gersonis de Imitatione Christi&rdquo; (<i>Directory</i>, iii.
            2).</p>

            is explained that by &ldquo;week&rdquo; is meant not a space of time, seven
            days, but a distinct subject of meditation. The drill may be
            finished within seven or eight days; it may have to be prolonged
            beyond the twenty-five. The first meditation is the basis of
            all, and it may have to be repeated over and over again until
            the soul is sufficiently bruised (<i>Directory</i>, xi. l).</p>

            was fond of recalling these accusations and acquittals. In a

            that these accusations had really arisen, not from any associations

            in his <i>Leitfaden zum studium der Dogmengeschichte</i> (Halle
            a. S. 1893) declares that the following tendencies within the
            Roman Catholic Church of the sixteenth century have all to be
            taken into account as influencing the decisions come to at the
            Council of Trent: The reorganisation of the Spanish Church in
            strict medi&aelig;val spirit <i>by the Crown</i> under Isabella
            and Ferdinand; the revival of Thomist theology, especially in
            the Dominican Order; the fostering of mystical piety, especially
            in new and in reconstructed Orders; the ennobling of theology
            by Humanism, and its influence, direct and indirect, in leading
            theologians back to Augustine; the strengthening of the Papacy
            in the rise of Curialism; and, lastly, the ecclesiastical interests
            of temporal sovereigns generally opposed to this Curialism. He
            declares that the newly-founded Order of the Jesuits served as
            a meeting-place for the first, third, fourth, and fifth of these
            tendencies (pp. 333-34).</p>
